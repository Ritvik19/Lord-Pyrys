A little more revealing than I normally do, as she didn't really care much about the towel I was using to cover my midsection. Other than a few close swipes to my private bits, I had no way of anticipating what was about to happen. When the massage finished, she gave me a robe and took me to the table shower room. I layed face down on the table and she started cleaning every crack in my body. When I flipped over, she did the same until she got to my private parts. She started to clean them and I though, \"wow, this is kind of intense right now.\" For the first 20 seconds or so I just legitimately thought she was thoroughly cleaning my crotch area, but then I got a little, uh, aroused. I didn't say a damn thing though. She just started going after it. It was actually really awesome, but very unexpected? Still trying to sort out my feelings on it.</td>\n",

       "13  > I walked into the massage parlor and said I'd like a medium pressure massage. There weren't busy, so she took me back straight away. She asked if I also wanted a table shower. I had no idea what that was and she said it's just a way to get clean after the oils and such. My 60 minute massage was great. A little more revealing than I normally do, as she didn't really care much about the towel I was using to cover my midsection. Other than a few close swipes to my private bits, I had no way of anticipating what was about to happen. When the massage finished, she gave me a robe and took me to the table shower room. I layed face down on the table and she started cleaning every crack in my body. When I flipped over, she did the same until she got to my private parts. She started to clean them and I though, \"wow, this is kind of intense right now.\" For the first 20 seconds or so I just legitimately thought she was thoroughly cleaning my crotch area, but then I got a little, uh, aroused. I didn't say a damn thing though. She just started going after it. It was actually really awesome, but very unexpected? Still trying to sort out my feelings on it.  \n",
