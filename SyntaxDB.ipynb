       "240  Inheritance is used to inherit another class' members, including fields and methods. A subclass extends a base class' members.\\nThe super keyword is used to access the super class' member.\\nWhen a method is overridden, the compiler checks to see if the same method declaration exists in the super class. Override can be prevented using the 'final' keyword.\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

The default variable specifier is '%v', which is a catch-all for most variable types.\\nSpecifiers depend on variable type: %d (decimal), %f (floating-point), %e or %E (floating-point in scientific notation), %g or %G (uses the shorter version of %f or %e / %E), %s (strings).\\nFor floating point numbers, precision can be indicated (the number of decimal points wanted) by adding: %.3f, where 3 represents the number of deicmal points.\\nTo pad a number with zeros, add %03f, where 3 indicates the total number of values. Using %#x (with the x specifier), the number will be converted to hexadecimal.\\nMultiple specifiers can be used in this order: %[flag][width][.][precision][conversion specifier]. The flag can be: #, 0 (padding), -, + (shifting). The precison determines the max number placements where the width determines the min number placements %4.3f, where 4 represents the width and 3 represents the precision.
