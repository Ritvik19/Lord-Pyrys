A much more stable case is C=C-C=C, as the electrons involved can move about more freely. Note that the notation here can confound as it does not (as I wrote it at least) imply a free movement of electrons, look up conjugated systems. The aromatic ring is the highest form of this freedom.\\n\\nA triple bond is similar to the C=C=C bond in imposing a linearity to the molecule, so forcing the structure in a ring will have a strain and only be possible with a certain number of carbon atoms forming said ring.\\n\\nFrom an orbital point of view the alternating single and triple bonds sounds more likely because it would allow the delocalization that the allene-like ring would not.</td>\n",

More frequent ejaculation may influence the function of peripheral-zone epithelial cells, hindering the metabolic switch from citrate secretion to citrate oxidation known to occur early in prostate tumorigenesis [33]. Alternatively, more frequent ejaculation may reduce the development of prostatic intraluminal crystalloids, which have been associated with higher risk of PCa [34,35]. Higher ejaculatory frequency may be linked to lowering of psychological tension and central sympathetic nervous system suppression, which could dampen the stimulation of prostate epithelial cell division [36]. Given the lack of modifiable risk factors identified for PCa to date, the specific biological mechanisms underlying these associations are worthy of further investigation.\\n\\n(PCa = prostate cancer)\\n\\nThose are some of the main proposed explanations, if there is a causal link (which is unproven, but suggested by data so far).\\n\\nAnd yes, it is difficult to demonstrate a causal link.</td>\n",

It turns out that small chain alcohols are much better hydrogen bond donors and even better acceptors. This is due to the inductive affects of the carbon groups on the electron density of the oxygen. As such, they form stronger hydrogen bonds with the water molecules. This has been shown experimentally [here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpca.5b06678) and [here](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2011/cp/c1cp20182d/unauth#!divAbstract).</td>\n",

       "3  I believe it was a discussion point which of the two forms was the most likely/stable.\\n\\nIn both cases you will have a strain on the molecules. Structures with C=C=C are geometrically peculiar, with the double bonds being twisted and electrons unable to flow between the orbitals (look up allenes). A much more stable case is C=C-C=C, as the electrons involved can move about more freely. Note that the notation here can confound as it does not (as I wrote it at least) imply a free movement of electrons, look up conjugated systems. The aromatic ring is the highest form of this freedom.\\n\\nA triple bond is similar to the C=C=C bond in imposing a linearity to the molecule, so forcing the structure in a ring will have a strain and only be possible with a certain number of carbon atoms forming said ring.\\n\\nFrom an orbital point of view the alternating single and triple bonds sounds more likely because it would allow the delocalization that the allene-like ring would not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

Usually this is not desirable, but there may be cases where it is.\\n\\nSo I’d turn your questions around and state that in general you will want reactions taking place in a solvent that is suitable for your reaction and add the reactant slowly to the solution. \\nIn some uncommon cases you might prefer a more direct but less controlled and potentially dangerous path of mixing highly concentrated species.\\n\\nBut maybe you have other applications in mind other than chemical synthesis?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

More frequent ejaculation may influence the function of peripheral-zone epithelial cells, hindering the metabolic switch from citrate secretion to citrate oxidation known to occur early in prostate tumorigenesis [33]. Alternatively, more frequent ejaculation may reduce the development of prostatic intraluminal crystalloids, which have been associated with higher risk of PCa [34,35]. Higher ejaculatory frequency may be linked to lowering of psychological tension and central sympathetic nervous system suppression, which could dampen the stimulation of prostate epithelial cell division [36]. Given the lack of modifiable risk factors identified for PCa to date, the specific biological mechanisms underlying these associations are worthy of further investigation.\\n\\n(PCa = prostate cancer)\\n\\nThose are some of the main proposed explanations, if there is a causal link (which is unproven, but suggested by data so far).\\n\\nAnd yes, it is difficult to demonstrate a causal link.   \n",

       "3  Speaking of linearity and the forms that carbon chains will form: does this greatly increase the possibilities that we’d find the alternating single-double bond *ring* in nature (benzene)? On the face of it, it would seem very unlikely to occur naturally if one does not understand the twisting forces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "2  Hydrogen bonding.  The water is better at it than ethanol so when the O and H get together they don't really \"form\" a complex or crystal but it's a pattern similar to that.  It draws everything closer and likely increases density. This releases energy which you notice as warmth.\\n\\nHeat of mixing for two substances generally comes from this sort of complexing between things with different charges.\\n\\nSimplest to see clearly is NaOH.

       "5  I'll try to elaborate :)\\n\\nI was thinking of situations where you mix a small amount of powder/liquid with a larger amount of liquid. For example dissolving something in water/ethanol/diethyl ether in a lab. \\n\\nOr in the kitchen when baking a cake you start with dry ingredients, then mix in liquids. Or when whisking sugar and egg whites, you add the egg whites into the sugar. Or chocolate milk you add milk on top of chocolate powder.\\n\\nOr when mixing cocktails, you add sugar, herbs, alcohol, then big amount of soda.\\n\\nI guess there's two things here. Mixing powder with a big amount of liquid, and mixing liquid with a big amount of liquid.\\n\\nMy chemistry teacher (high school) told me to start with the small amount, then add a little bit of the solvent and make a slurry, and then you dilute it further to the desired volume. Maybe there's some confirmation bias, but I feel like the recipes support this method, and I feel like that this method is actually really good (avoid clumps in pancakes etc.)\\n\\nIntuitively it feels very wrong to take the small amount of substance and pouring it on top of a container full of solvent.\\n\\nI hope that helped specify what I mean.   \n",

       "5  I tried to elaborate in another comment, I'll copy/paste.\\n\\nThe things you mentioned were very much the kinda stuff I was looking for, thanks!\\n\\n> I'll try to elaborate :)\\n\\nI was thinking of situations where you mix a small amount of powder/liquid with a larger amount of liquid. For example dissolving something in water/ethanol/diethyl ether in a lab.\\n\\nOr in the kitchen when baking a cake you start with dry ingredients, then mix in liquids. Or when whisking sugar and egg whites, you add the egg whites into the sugar. Or chocolate milk you add milk on top of chocolate powder.\\n\\nOr when mixing cocktails, you add sugar, herbs, alcohol, then big amount of soda.\\n\\nI guess there's two things here. Mixing powder with a big amount of liquid, and mixing liquid with a big amount of liquid.\\n\\nMy chemistry teacher (high school) told me to start with the small amount, then add a little bit of the solvent and make a slurry, and then you dilute it further to the desired volume. Maybe there's some confirmation bias, but I feel like the recipes support this method, and I feel like that this method is actually really good (avoid clumps in pancakes etc.)\\n\\nIntuitively it feels very wrong to take the small amount of substance and pouring it on top of a container full of solvent.\\n\\nI hope that helped specify what I mean.  \n",
