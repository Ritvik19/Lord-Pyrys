It had momentum *p*, so after reflection it'll have momentum *-p*. The photon lost 2*p* worth of momentum, so because of conservation of momentum, we know that the spacecraft gained 2*p* worth of momentum in this exchange.\\n\\nClearly, by reflecting the photon, the amount of momentum transferred is double what it would've been had the photon been absorbed.\\n\\nIf the photon doesn't travel on a path perpendicular to the sail, but instead strikes it at an angle, the result is the same. In this case, you can split the momentum of the photon into two components: the momentum perpendicular to the sail and the momentum parallel to the sail. If the photon is absorbed, the space craft gains both components of the momentum, but nothing more.\\n\\nBut if the photon is reflected, the outgoing photon will have both components of its momentum flipped, making the change in momentum for each component twice the original magnitude of that component.

       "      <td>This is the old [tired light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tired_light) hypothesis. \\n\\nPart of the problem redshift is far too *clean* to be an interaction effect. Looking at spectra - where we split the light from an object into individual wavelengths - we see very narrow lines of emission from very distant galaxies. Interactions wouldn't uniformly produce such a tidy shift of such a narrow line. It's be more of a random process, where individual photons may or may not hit a dark matter particle (or whatever) and get scattered/absorbed/whatever. So your narrow line would broaden as different photons are redshifted by different amounts.\\n\\nAlso, we have observed that supernovae at high redshift are slower than nearby supernovae - by an amount that's directly proportional to redshift. This is pretty clear evidence of time dilation caused by the expansion of the universe.\\n\\nAlso, if dark matter was the source of these interactions, we'd expect them to vary with location. Dark matter isn't uniform - it's collected into \"halos\", giant blobs of dark matter that contain galaxy clusters (or groups), that contain sub-blobs of dark matter that contain galaxies, that contain smaller sub-blobs of dark matter that contain dwarf galaxies and so on. So you'd expect to see different redshift when you look through a dense galaxy cluster than looking through open space. You wouldn't get such a uniform redshift-distance relation.\\n\\nAlthough, in a sense, it *is* dark *energy* that's causing the redshift. Dark energy is essentially a placeholder term for whatever effect is causing the universe to accelerate its expansion. This expansion is what causes redshift, and so dark energy does indeed contribute to redshift.</td>\n",
       "      <td>The idea that cosmological redshift could be explained by light  losing energy by interacting on the way has long been debunked (see Weinberg Cosmology). It would look different so it's incompatible with observations. \\n\\n&gt;Is it possible that the universe is really static, and that photons  simply suffer a loss of energy and hence a decrease in frequency as they travel to us, the loss of energy and hence the redshift naturally increasing with the distance that the photons have to travel?\\n\\n&gt;It is possible to rule out all these possibilities by comparing the\\nluminosity distance d_L(z) with the angular diameter distance d_A(z) of the same distant source. None of the possibilities mentioned above can affect the angular diameter distance, while the conventional interpretation of redshifts and luminosities provides the model-independent result (1.4.12), that d_L(z)/d_A(z) = (1 + z)² , so a verification of this ratio can confirm the conventional understanding of d_L(z).\\n\\n&gt;We can check this formula for d_L(z)/d_A(z) by a \"surface brightness test\" suggested long ago by Tolman[1]. If a light source has an absolute luminosity per proper area L, then the apparent luminosity of a patch of area A will be l = LA/4πd_L² . This patch will subtend a solid angle Ω = A/d_A².\\nThe surface brightness B is defined as the apparent luminosity per solid angle, so B = l/Ω = L d_A² / (4π d_L²).\\n\\n&gt;In the conventional big bang cosmology the ratio d_A/d_L is given by Eq. (1.4.12), so B = (1+z)^(-4) L/4π\\n\\n&gt;If we can find a class of light sources with a common value for the absolute luminosity per proper area L, then their surface brightness should be found to decrease with redshift precisely as (1 + z)^(-4) .\\nFor instance, one important difference between \"tired light\" theories and the conventional big bang theory is that in the conventional theory all rates at the source are decreased by a factor (1 + z)^(-1), while in tired light theories there is no such slowing down. One rate that is slowed down at large redshifts in the conventional theory is the rate at which photons are emitted by the source. This is responsible for one of the two factors of (1 + z)^(-1) in formula (1.4.1) for apparent luminosity, the other factor being due to the reduction of energy of individual photons. On the other hand, if\\nthe rate of photon emission is not affected by the redshift, then in a static Euclidean universe in which photons lose energy as they travel to us, the apparent luminosity of a distant source L at a distance d will be given by L/4π(1 + z)d², with only a single factor 1 + z in the denominator to take account of the photon energy loss. That is, the luminosity distance will be (1 + z)^(1/2) d, while the angular diameter distance in a Euclidean universe is just d, so here d_L / d_A = (1 + z)^(1/2) , and the surface brightness of distant galaxies should decrease as (1 + z)^(-1).\\n\\n&gt;Lubin and Sandage[2] have used the Hubble Space Telescope to compare the surface brightness of galaxies in three distant clusters with redshifts 0.76, 0.90, and 0.92 with the surface brightness measured in closer galaxies. They detect a decrease of B with increasing z that is consistent with Eq. (1.7.2) with reasonable corrections for the effects of galaxy evolution, and is quite inconsistent with the behavior B ~ (1+z)^(-1) expected in a static\\nuniverse with \"tired light\".\\n\\n&gt;In the standard big bang cosmology all rates observed from a distant source are slowed by a factor 1/(1 + z), not just the rate at which photons are emitted. This slowing has been confirmed[3] for the rate of decline of light from some of the Type Ia supernovae used by the Supernova Cosmology Project discussed in the previous section. The hypothesis that the absolute luminosity is simply correlated with the intrinsic decline time is found to work much better if the observed decline time is taken to be the intrinsic decline time stretched out by a factor 1 + z. Nothing like this would be expected in a static Euclidean universe with redshifts attributed to tired light.\\n\\n&gt;[1] R. C. Tolman, Proc. Nat. Acad.

       "      <td>It kills you in a few, very nasty ways, but first lets look at what a shockwave actually is.\\n\\nIn an explosion, lets say a non-nuclear bomb while ignoring everything except blast effects, you have a very small volume expanding at a velocity far greater than the speed of sound. This pushes the air out of the way, which causes piston heating and a high pressure region at the front of the shock. This high pressure region is what \"hits\" you and sweeps drag-sensitive targets away. However for an animal it needs to be quite a huge shock, or you need to be very close for this to kill you. \\n\\nBehind the high pressure region of the leading edge (overpressure region) is a region of much *much* lower pressure (underpressure region) , far lower than the atmospheric pressure at that elevation. This is incredibly harmful to us, especially in concert with the overpressure region. We have gasses in our bodies, our lungs and intestines being the most obvious, but in other parts as well. The overpressure wave compresses this, and then underpressure wave causes rapid and potentially catastrophic expansion. In extremes your lungs burst, as will your guts. Your inner ears will rupture, your eyeballs may fly out. Blood vessels are damaged, and tissues in general can be pulverized. \\n\\nThe fire comes later in a conventional explosive, but the actual \"burning\" of the explosive really isn't a factor unless you're already so close that you're going to be chunks. Shrapnel, both primary (from the bomb itself) and secondary from objects in the environment (such as fragments of bone and building material) are the biggest killers, and remain deadly far longer than the \"fire\" does.\\n\\nThere are exceptions. A nuclear bomb's first effect is to dump a huge amount of its total energy as a thermal pulse, that outruns the shockwave to a great degree. Like large fuel-air or thermobaric weapons, it also will create a vacuum that surrounding air is drawn strongly to. There are stories of people in the effective radius of a \"Daisy Cutter\" who actually died when their lungs burst from their mouths. \\n\\nSo in short, explosives kill with (potentially) a thermal pulse, then the shockwave, with shrapnel, through fires started by the explosive and disruption of electrical/gas systems, and through structural collapse of affected structures.\\n\\nEdit: The CDC has a very good guide to this https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docket/archive/pdfs/NIOSH-125/125-ExplosionsandRefugeChambers.pdf\\n\\nFor nuclear weapons (also applies well to enormous industrial disasters, and a few historical accidents with explosives or rockets): http://www.atomicarchive.com/Effects/effects4.shtml</td>\n",
       "      <td>One common fatal effect is through blast-induced traumatic brain injury. The highly compressed air of a shockwave enters the skull through the eyes or sinuses where it can cause soft tissue damage to the brain. A face mask that covers the openings of the skull can protect the brain by preventing the initial entry of the shockwave.</td>\n",
       "      <td>This is a good description. In addition  [this source](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/cnc-2017-0006) gives the following. \\n\\n&gt; Based on his extensive experimental work \\[[**18**](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/cnc-2017-0006#B18),[**25–28**](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/cnc-2017-0006#B25%20B26%20B27%20B28)\\], Clemedson postulated that the impulse of the pressure wave and/or the pressure variations along the wave’s propagation throughout the body generate tissue-specific responses \\[[**18**](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/cnc-2017-0006#B18)\\]. The historic explanations of the pressure wave–tissue interactions suggested spalling, inertia, implosion and cavitation as the main mechanisms \\[[**6**](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/cnc-2017-0006#B6),[**29**](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/cnc-2017-0006#B29)\\]. Spallation develops at the interface between two media of different densities. As the pressure wave propagates across the denser medium toward a medium of lower density, it reflects from the boundary, creates a defect (i.e., crater) in that denser medium, and spall fractures and fragments from the boundary. Inertial effects also happen at the interface of the different densities. Namely, while tissue components with the lightest density travel the fastest, denser elements lag behind. The physical movements’ differing velocities cause stretch and strain at the interfaces, and consequently, lead to displacement, deformation or rupture of tissues and organs \\[[**17**](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/cnc-2017-0006#B17),[**27**](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/cnc-2017-0006#B27),[**30**](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/cnc-2017-0006#B30)\\]. Implosion occurs when the pressure wave passes through a liquid medium containing dissolved gas. The kinetic energy of the pressure wave compresses the gas bubbles, so that the bubbles’ pressure becomes higher than the wave’s pressure. After the passage of the pressure wave, the bubbles re-expand and burst damaging the surrounding tissue; this mechanism is often called cavitation \\[[**31**](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/cnc-2017-0006#B31)\\]. Besides the tissue damage caused by mechanism explained above, some findings indicate that the damaging effects of the primary blast might also depend on the frequency of the shock wave. For example, it was posited that high-frequency (0.5–1.5 kHz), low-amplitude stress waves target mostly organs consisting of structures with different densities. Examples of such organs include the lungs that contain air, blood and parenchyma or the brain with multiple interfaces between fluid (blood or cerebrospinal fluid) and parenchyma. On the other hand, low-frequency (&lt;0.5 kHz), high-amplitude shear waves have been suggested to induce tissue damage by generating local motions that overcome the tissue’s natural elasticity (e.g., at the gray–white brain matter interface) \\[[**32**](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/cnc-2017-0006#B32)\\]. \\n\\nA similarly gruesome description</td>\n",

       "3  Consider 2 scenarios: The first is a sail that is completely non-reflective and the second is a sail that is perfectly reflective. Now consider a photon with momentum *p* striking the sail from a direction perpendicular to the sail.\\n\\nIn scenario 1, the full momentum *p* is transferred to the sail. The photon is absorbed and ceases to exist and the spacecraft now has an increase in momentum of *p* in the direction that the photon was traveling.\\n\\nIn scenario 2, the photon is reflected and will travel back in the same direction that it came from. It had momentum *p*, so after reflection it'll have momentum *-p*. The photon lost 2*p* worth of momentum, so because of conservation of momentum, we know that the spacecraft gained 2*p* worth of momentum in this exchange.\\n\\nClearly, by reflecting the photon, the amount of momentum transferred is double what it would've been had the photon been absorbed.\\n\\nIf the photon doesn't travel on a path perpendicular to the sail, but instead strikes it at an angle, the result is the same. In this case, you can split the momentum of the photon into two components: the momentum perpendicular to the sail and the momentum parallel to the sail. If the photon is absorbed, the space craft gains both components of the momentum, but nothing more.\\n\\nBut if the photon is reflected, the outgoing photon will have both components of its momentum flipped, making the change in momentum for each component twice the original magnitude of that component. And that difference is gained by the space craft. Again, the effect of perfect reflection is twice that of perfect absorption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

And you used the example of acute inflammation from a TBI; could these proteins be used for other kinds of inflammation as well, such as the chronic inflammation found in autoimmune diseases?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "5  This is the old [tired light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tired_light) hypothesis. \\n\\nPart of the problem redshift is far too *clean* to be an interaction effect. Looking at spectra - where we split the light from an object into individual wavelengths - we see very narrow lines of emission from very distant galaxies. Interactions wouldn't uniformly produce such a tidy shift of such a narrow line. It's be more of a random process, where individual photons may or may not hit a dark matter particle (or whatever) and get scattered/absorbed/whatever. So your narrow line would broaden as different photons are redshifted by different amounts.\\n\\nAlso, we have observed that supernovae at high redshift are slower than nearby supernovae - by an amount that's directly proportional to redshift. This is pretty clear evidence of time dilation caused by the expansion of the universe.\\n\\nAlso, if dark matter was the source of these interactions, we'd expect them to vary with location. Dark matter isn't uniform - it's collected into \"halos\", giant blobs of dark matter that contain galaxy clusters (or groups), that contain sub-blobs of dark matter that contain galaxies, that contain smaller sub-blobs of dark matter that contain dwarf galaxies and so on. So you'd expect to see different redshift when you look through a dense galaxy cluster than looking through open space. You wouldn't get such a uniform redshift-distance relation.\\n\\nAlthough, in a sense, it *is* dark *energy* that's causing the redshift. Dark energy is essentially a placeholder term for whatever effect is causing the universe to accelerate its expansion. This expansion is what causes redshift, and so dark energy does indeed contribute to redshift.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "9  It kills you in a few, very nasty ways, but first lets look at what a shockwave actually is.\\n\\nIn an explosion, lets say a non-nuclear bomb while ignoring everything except blast effects, you have a very small volume expanding at a velocity far greater than the speed of sound. This pushes the air out of the way, which causes piston heating and a high pressure region at the front of the shock. This high pressure region is what \"hits\" you and sweeps drag-sensitive targets away. However for an animal it needs to be quite a huge shock, or you need to be very close for this to kill you. \\n\\nBehind the high pressure region of the leading edge (overpressure region) is a region of much *much* lower pressure (underpressure region) , far lower than the atmospheric pressure at that elevation. This is incredibly harmful to us, especially in concert with the overpressure region. We have gasses in our bodies, our lungs and intestines being the most obvious, but in other parts as well. The overpressure wave compresses this, and then underpressure wave causes rapid and potentially catastrophic expansion. In extremes your lungs burst, as will your guts. Your inner ears will rupture, your eyeballs may fly out. Blood vessels are damaged, and tissues in general can be pulverized. \\n\\nThe fire comes later in a conventional explosive, but the actual \"burning\" of the explosive really isn't a factor unless you're already so close that you're going to be chunks. Shrapnel, both primary (from the bomb itself) and secondary from objects in the environment (such as fragments of bone and building material) are the biggest killers, and remain deadly far longer than the \"fire\" does.\\n\\nThere are exceptions. A nuclear bomb's first effect is to dump a huge amount of its total energy as a thermal pulse, that outruns the shockwave to a great degree. Like large fuel-air or thermobaric weapons, it also will create a vacuum that surrounding air is drawn strongly to. There are stories of people in the effective radius of a \"Daisy Cutter\" who actually died when their lungs burst from their mouths. \\n\\nSo in short, explosives kill with (potentially) a thermal pulse, then the shockwave, with shrapnel, through fires started by the explosive and disruption of electrical/gas systems, and through structural collapse of affected structures.\\n\\nEdit: The CDC has a very good guide to this https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docket/archive/pdfs/NIOSH-125/125-ExplosionsandRefugeChambers.pdf\\n\\nFor nuclear weapons (also applies well to enormous industrial disasters, and a few historical accidents with explosives or rockets): http://www.atomicarchive.com/Effects/effects4.shtml   \n",

Even a ballpark guestimation would be interesting.\\n\\nThanks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "2  Well not close it off completely, but we could possibly in the future have solar panels that orbit the sun like satellites do on earth, but just bigger ofc.\\n\\nSaw it on some YouTube video who did the math, you would just have to need way more material than we could ever dream of getting, to surround the whole sun. I'm talking planet crushing machines, and you would probably need multiple planets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "5  The idea that cosmological redshift could be explained by light  losing energy by interacting on the way has long been debunked (see Weinberg Cosmology). It would look different so it's incompatible with observations. \\n\\n>Is it possible that the universe is really static, and that photons  simply suffer a loss of energy and hence a decrease in frequency as they travel to us, the loss of energy and hence the redshift naturally increasing with the distance that the photons have to travel?\\n\\n>It is possible to rule out all these possibilities by comparing the\\nluminosity distance d_L(z) with the angular diameter distance d_A(z) of the same distant source. None of the possibilities mentioned above can affect the angular diameter distance, while the conventional interpretation of redshifts and luminosities provides the model-independent result (1.4.12), that d_L(z)/d_A(z) = (1 + z)² , so a verification of this ratio can confirm the conventional understanding of d_L(z).\\n\\n>We can check this formula for d_L(z)/d_A(z) by a \"surface brightness test\" suggested long ago by Tolman[1]. If a light source has an absolute luminosity per proper area L, then the apparent luminosity of a patch of area A will be l = LA/4πd_L² . This patch will subtend a solid angle Ω = A/d_A².\\nThe surface brightness B is defined as the apparent luminosity per solid angle, so B = l/Ω = L d_A² / (4π d_L²).\\n\\n>In the conventional big bang cosmology the ratio d_A/d_L is given by Eq. (1.4.12), so B = (1+z)^(-4) L/4π\\n\\n>If we can find a class of light sources with a common value for the absolute luminosity per proper area L, then their surface brightness should be found to decrease with redshift precisely as (1 + z)^(-4) .\\nFor instance, one important difference between \"tired light\" theories and the conventional big bang theory is that in the conventional theory all rates at the source are decreased by a factor (1 + z)^(-1), while in tired light theories there is no such slowing down. One rate that is slowed down at large redshifts in the conventional theory is the rate at which photons are emitted by the source. This is responsible for one of the two factors of (1 + z)^(-1) in formula (1.4.1) for apparent luminosity, the other factor being due to the reduction of energy of individual photons. On the other hand, if\\nthe rate of photon emission is not affected by the redshift, then in a static Euclidean universe in which photons lose energy as they travel to us, the apparent luminosity of a distant source L at a distance d will be given by L/4π(1 + z)d², with only a single factor 1 + z in the denominator to take account of the photon energy loss. That is, the luminosity distance will be (1 + z)^(1/2) d, while the angular diameter distance in a Euclidean universe is just d, so here d_L / d_A = (1 + z)^(1/2) , and the surface brightness of distant galaxies should decrease as (1 + z)^(-1).\\n\\n>Lubin and Sandage[2] have used the Hubble Space Telescope to compare the surface brightness of galaxies in three distant clusters with redshifts 0.76, 0.90, and 0.92 with the surface brightness measured in closer galaxies. They detect a decrease of B with increasing z that is consistent with Eq. (1.7.2) with reasonable corrections for the effects of galaxy evolution, and is quite inconsistent with the behavior B ~ (1+z)^(-1) expected in a static\\nuniverse with \"tired light\".\\n\\n>In the standard big bang cosmology all rates observed from a distant source are slowed by a factor 1/(1 + z), not just the rate at which photons are emitted. This slowing has been confirmed[3] for the rate of decline of light from some of the Type Ia supernovae used by the Supernova Cosmology Project discussed in the previous section. The hypothesis that the absolute luminosity is simply correlated with the intrinsic decline time is found to work much better if the observed decline time is taken to be the intrinsic decline time stretched out by a factor 1 + z. Nothing like this would be expected in a static Euclidean universe with redshifts attributed to tired light.\\n\\n>[1] R. C. Tolman, Proc. Nat. Acad.

A face mask that covers the openings of the skull can protect the brain by preventing the initial entry of the shockwave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

Using reflective sails that can be angled, you gain the flexibility to accelerate in other directions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "0  Hey guys, really interesting stuff. Molecular biologist here, so please do get technical.\\n\\nI did not see an explanation as to how protein transcription is achieved - it is endogenous, right? How is the code implemented into the genome or is it ? How is transcription (or protein expression levels) regulated?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "2  That is what is called a Dyson sphere. You would need to dismantle a whole bunch of planets to get enough material for one. It will have to be massive or anything inside it would fry. \\n\\nThat being said, if you are asking as a way to maximize solar power generation, then you don’t need to surround the sun at all, all you need is to put your solar panel outside the atmosphere where they would get a whole lot more energy.

The real mystery is what drives the constant energy density of empty space.\\n\\nSo while new theories can be presented, they have the burden of toppling one of the most robustly tested theories in all of physics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "9  This is a good description. In addition  [this source](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/cnc-2017-0006) gives the following. \\n\\n> Based on his extensive experimental work \\[[**18**](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/cnc-2017-0006#B18),[**25–28**](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/cnc-2017-0006#B25%20B26%20B27%20B28)\\], Clemedson postulated that the impulse of the pressure wave and/or the pressure variations along the wave’s propagation throughout the body generate tissue-specific responses \\[[**18**](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/cnc-2017-0006#B18)\\]. The historic explanations of the pressure wave–tissue interactions suggested spalling, inertia, implosion and cavitation as the main mechanisms \\[[**6**](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/cnc-2017-0006#B6),[**29**](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/cnc-2017-0006#B29)\\]. Spallation develops at the interface between two media of different densities. As the pressure wave propagates across the denser medium toward a medium of lower density, it reflects from the boundary, creates a defect (i.e., crater) in that denser medium, and spall fractures and fragments from the boundary. Inertial effects also happen at the interface of the different densities. Namely, while tissue components with the lightest density travel the fastest, denser elements lag behind. The physical movements’ differing velocities cause stretch and strain at the interfaces, and consequently, lead to displacement, deformation or rupture of tissues and organs \\[[**17**](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/cnc-2017-0006#B17),[**27**](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/cnc-2017-0006#B27),[**30**](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/cnc-2017-0006#B30)\\]. Implosion occurs when the pressure wave passes through a liquid medium containing dissolved gas. The kinetic energy of the pressure wave compresses the gas bubbles, so that the bubbles’ pressure becomes higher than the wave’s pressure. After the passage of the pressure wave, the bubbles re-expand and burst damaging the surrounding tissue; this mechanism is often called cavitation \\[[**31**](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/cnc-2017-0006#B31)\\]. Besides the tissue damage caused by mechanism explained above, some findings indicate that the damaging effects of the primary blast might also depend on the frequency of the shock wave. For example, it was posited that high-frequency (0.5–1.5 kHz), low-amplitude stress waves target mostly organs consisting of structures with different densities. Examples of such organs include the lungs that contain air, blood and parenchyma or the brain with multiple interfaces between fluid (blood or cerebrospinal fluid) and parenchyma. On the other hand, low-frequency (<0.5 kHz), high-amplitude shear waves have been suggested to induce tissue damage by generating local motions that overcome the tissue’s natural elasticity (e.g., at the gray–white brain matter interface) \\[[**32**](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/cnc-2017-0006#B32)\\]. \\n\\nA similarly gruesome description   \n",

This is pretty clear evidence of **time dilation** caused by the expansion of the universe.\\n\\nI don't think that's correct. Expansion doesn't cause time dilation.\\n\\nMore distant supernovae are more red-shifted, but that's because the photons have travelled through a greater amount of expanding space, not because of time dilation.\\n\\nEdit: I found this:\\n\\nhttps://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13792-cosmic-time-warp-revealed-in-slow-motion-supernovae/\\n\\nBut it's clear that it's only \"time dilation\" in air quotes, and not *actual* time dilation.

Since the photon is carrying energy away still if it's reflected, but not if it was absorbed?\\n\\nI'm just confused  \n",
