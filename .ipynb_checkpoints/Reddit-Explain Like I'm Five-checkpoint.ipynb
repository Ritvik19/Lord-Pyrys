Wall incoming...\\n\\n.\\n\\nThe first part is the [innate immune system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system), which *most* organisms have some form of. It depends on a basic set of receptors for specific structures common to pathogens. For example, lots of bacteria have flagella, whiplike structures poking out of their bodies to move/swim. They're made of a protein called flagellin, which isn't in any of our cells. Innate immune cells have a specific receptor for flagellin. If there's some in your liver, neutrophils, macrophages, etc. recognize that it's not supposed to be there, and they gobble up or poison the bacteria.  \\n\\n**Analogy:** Your body is a country where everyone wears blue T-shirts and Levi's jeans and no one ever wears hats. Bacteria and viruses can wear hats or other clothes. The innate immune system is a militia army all across the country. They wear mass-produced special goggles that trigger a DANGER signal when they see someone wearing hats, or jackets, or leggings. Then they group up and go fight them with knives and axes.\\n\\n.\\n\\nBut that doesn't always work, some bacteria might mutate their flagellin to be less \"visible\" (camo hats) or just hide it outright. Sometimes a single bacteria is growing a *lot*, and you just need something more specific to that one. Enter the [adaptive immune system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system). This evolved later: vertebrate animals have it, but not invertebrates, plants, or fungi. And this one is *wack*. Instead of specifically targeting molecules that are definitely on pathogens, they target anything and everything that is *not* found in you. Adaptive immune cells (T cells and B cells) are each created with a *single* receptor that is randomly mutated in specific spots, so that it might detect any one protein. One T cell might react against a bacterial protein, another might react against a plant protein, another might actually react to a human lung protein. The reason your immune system isn't constantly attacking your own body is because during the maturation process, special cells show self-proteins to those T and B cells, and if they react too strongly, they get killed. Once they pass this, they're released into the rest of the body. If they detect something, it's almost definitely *not* self, and they multiply like crazy to take down that one thing, either by (T cells) directly killing your own infected cells, or (B cells) creating antibodies that stick to them and flag them for the innate immune system. I could say so much more, but this is already way too long, so...  \\n\\n**Analogy:** Each adaptive immune cell is a soldier that handcrafts a unique pair of goggles. These goggles detect, for example, *only* red and yellow plaid shirts, or *only* Calvin jeans with flowers on them. Some soldiers might accidentally end up with goggles that flag blue T-shirts or Levi's jeans, but they get eliminated before they can go around shooting everyone. The system operates on the principle that if people in those clothes are supposed to be here, the goggles for those clothes wouldn't exist. Many many many of these soldiers with these unique goggles are trained, and most of them go their whole lives without shooting anybody. But once someone's goggles detect something, they call in a SWAT team to shoot everyone carrying that one feature.\\n\\n.\\n\\nHow does this relate to organ transplants? It all has to do with that second group. Your adaptive immune cells don't *know* that the foreign organ is supposed to help. Your soldiers don't know that that big group of people with white shirts and white pants is supposed to be another country's relief group coming in to help. Their goggles flag DANGER anyway. That's why when someone receives an organ transplant, they have to take immunosuppressants--stop the whole army.</td>\n",

       "12  To add more info on top of everyone else's direct answers to the question, the immune system isn't really one cohesive unit so much as a hodgepodge of different types of cells that stack on top of each other (but also talk to each other a ton). Wall incoming...\\n\\n.\\n\\nThe first part is the [innate immune system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system), which *most* organisms have some form of. It depends on a basic set of receptors for specific structures common to pathogens. For example, lots of bacteria have flagella, whiplike structures poking out of their bodies to move/swim. They're made of a protein called flagellin, which isn't in any of our cells. Innate immune cells have a specific receptor for flagellin. If there's some in your liver, neutrophils, macrophages, etc. recognize that it's not supposed to be there, and they gobble up or poison the bacteria.  \\n\\n**Analogy:** Your body is a country where everyone wears blue T-shirts and Levi's jeans and no one ever wears hats. Bacteria and viruses can wear hats or other clothes. The innate immune system is a militia army all across the country. They wear mass-produced special goggles that trigger a DANGER signal when they see someone wearing hats, or jackets, or leggings. Then they group up and go fight them with knives and axes.\\n\\n.\\n\\nBut that doesn't always work, some bacteria might mutate their flagellin to be less \"visible\" (camo hats) or just hide it outright. Sometimes a single bacteria is growing a *lot*, and you just need something more specific to that one. Enter the [adaptive immune system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system). This evolved later: vertebrate animals have it, but not invertebrates, plants, or fungi. And this one is *wack*. Instead of specifically targeting molecules that are definitely on pathogens, they target anything and everything that is *not* found in you. Adaptive immune cells (T cells and B cells) are each created with a *single* receptor that is randomly mutated in specific spots, so that it might detect any one protein. One T cell might react against a bacterial protein, another might react against a plant protein, another might actually react to a human lung protein. The reason your immune system isn't constantly attacking your own body is because during the maturation process, special cells show self-proteins to those T and B cells, and if they react too strongly, they get killed. Once they pass this, they're released into the rest of the body. If they detect something, it's almost definitely *not* self, and they multiply like crazy to take down that one thing, either by (T cells) directly killing your own infected cells, or (B cells) creating antibodies that stick to them and flag them for the innate immune system. I could say so much more, but this is already way too long, so...  \\n\\n**Analogy:** Each adaptive immune cell is a soldier that handcrafts a unique pair of goggles. These goggles detect, for example, *only* red and yellow plaid shirts, or *only* Calvin jeans with flowers on them. Some soldiers might accidentally end up with goggles that flag blue T-shirts or Levi's jeans, but they get eliminated before they can go around shooting everyone. The system operates on the principle that if people in those clothes are supposed to be here, the goggles for those clothes wouldn't exist. Many many many of these soldiers with these unique goggles are trained, and most of them go their whole lives without shooting anybody. But once someone's goggles detect something, they call in a SWAT team to shoot everyone carrying that one feature.\\n\\n.\\n\\nHow does this relate to organ transplants? It all has to do with that second group. Your adaptive immune cells don't *know* that the foreign organ is supposed to help. Your soldiers don't know that that big group of people with white shirts and white pants is supposed to be another country's relief group coming in to help. Their goggles flag DANGER anyway. That's why when someone receives an organ transplant, they have to take immunosuppressants--stop the whole army.  \n",
       "15  Magnets lose their magnetism over long periods of time, also arranging lots of magnets together they will eventually change to form a large single magnet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
