      "This is one of the oldest and most popular line clipping algorithm. To speed up the process this algorithm performs initial tests that reduce number of intersections that must be calculated. It does so by using a 4 bit code called as region code or outcodes. These codes identify location of the end point of line.\n",
      "Each bit position indicates a direction, starting from the rightmost position of each bit indicates left, right, bottom, top respectively.\n",
      "Once we establish region codes for both the endpoints of a line we determine whether the endpoint is visible, partially visible or invisible with the help of ANDing of the region codes.\n",

       "      <td>In this tutorial we will discuss about Breadth First Search or BFS program in C with algorithm and an example. Before jumping to actual coding lets discuss something about Graph and BFS.\\nAlso Read: Depth First Search (DFS) Traversal of a Graph [Algorithm and Program]\\nA Graph G = (V, E) is a collection of sets V and E where V is a collection of vertices and E is a collection of edges.\\nA Graph can be of two types:\\n1. Directed Graph\\n2. Undirected Graph\\nIn data structures, there is a popular term known as ‘Traversal’. It is the process of systematically visiting or examining (may be to update the Graph nodes) each node in a tree data structure, exactly once.\\nThere are two most common methods to traverse a Graph:\\n1. Breadth First Search\\n2. Depth First Search\\nIn this tutorial, we are going to focus on Breadth First Search technique.\\nIn this technique, we first visit the vertex and then visit all the vertices adjacent to the starting vertex i.e., 0. Next, we pick the adjacent vertices one after another and visit their adjacent vertices and this process goes on and on until we reach the last vertex.\\n \\nConsider below Graph as an example.\\n \\n\\n \\nThe vertex 0 is the starting vertex in our case. We start our traversal from the vertex 0. Then we will visit all vertices adjacent to vertex 0 i.e., 1, 4, 3. Here, we can visit these three vertices in any order. Suppose we visit the vertices in order 1,3,4.\\nThe traversal would be: 0 1 3 4\\nNow, we shall visit all the vertices adjacent to 1, then all the vertices adjacent to 3 and then all the vertices adjacent to 4. So first we shall visit 2 (since it is adjacent to 1), then 6 (since it is adjacent to 3) and 5, 7 (since these are adjacent to 4).\\nNote: Vertex 4 is adjacent to vertices 1 and 3, but it has already been visited so we’ve ignored it.\\nThe traversal would be: 0 1 3 4 2 6 5 7\\nNow, we shall visit all the vertices adjacent to 2, 6, 5, and 7 one by one. We can see that vertex 5 is adjacent to vertex 2. Since, it has already been traversed upon before, we have don’t need to traverse through it again and move on to the next vertex. Now, the vertices 4 and 7 are adjacent to the vertex 6. Since, they have been traversed upon before, we will not traverse on them again. Vertex 5 does not have any adjacent vertices. Vertices 5 and 8 are adjacent to vertex 7. Since, vertex 5 has been traversed upon before, we will not traverse it again. However, vertex 8 has not yet been visited. So we will traverse on vertex 8.\\nThe traversal would be: 0 1 3 4 2 6 5 7 8\\nNow, we need to visit vertices adjacent to vertex 8. However, there is no vertex adjacent to vertex 8 and hence we will have to stop the traversal here.\\nNote: There’s no unique traversal and it can be different based on the order of the successors.\\nWe shall look at a BFS program in C for directed Graph using a Queue. This program reaches only those vertices that are reachable from the start vertex.\\n \\n \\n \\nOutput\\n\\nIf you find anything incorrect or have any doubts regarding above Breadth First Search (BFS) program in C then comment below.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>In this tutorial you will learn about doubly linked list in C and C++.\\nIn singly linked list, we can move/traverse only in one single direction because each node has the address of the next node only. Suppose we are in the middle of the linked list and we want the address of previous node then we don’t have any option other than repeating the traversing from the beginning node.\\nTo overcome this drawback, a doubly linked list can be used. In this, there are two pointers. One of these pointers points to the next node and the other points to the previous node.\\n \\n\\nImage Source\\n \\nThe structure for a doubly linked list node can be declared as:\\n \\nprev_node would contain a pointer to the address of the previous node and next_node would point the next node in the list. Hence, we can move in both the directions.\\n \\nTraversal of a doubly linked list is similar to that of a singly linked list. We have to first check for a condition: whether the linked list is empty or not. This helps to set the start pointer at a proper location. After that we access each node till end.\\n \\nA new node can be inserted very easily in a doubly linked list. We just need to set the pointers prev_node and next_node carefully interlinking the prev_node and the next_node node with the appropriate pointers.\\nIf you’re inserting a Node n2 between Node n1 and n3, you should set the pointer prev_node of n2 to n1 and pointer next_node of n2 to n3.\\nInsertion in a doubly linked list can be done in multiple ways:\\n1. Insertion in between the nodes.\\n2. Insertion at the beginning.\\n3. Insertion in an empty list.\\n4. Insertion at the end of the list.\\n \\nA node can be deleted very easily in a doubly linked list. We just need to set the pointers prev_node and next_node logically to the nodes.\\nDeletion of the nodes can be done in the following ways:\\n1. Delete at the end.\\n2. Delete the first node.\\n3. Delete in between the nodes.\\n \\nAssume we have four nodes n1, n2, n3 and n4\\nSteps to reverse\\n1. Pointer begin points to the last node n4.\\n2. Since, the n4 is the first node now, its prev_node pointer must be NULL.\\n3. Node n1 is the last node, hence its next_node must be NULL.\\n4. Pointer next_node of n4 points to n3, next_node of n3 points to n2 and next_node of n2 points to n1.\\n5. Pointer prev_node of n1 points to n2, prev_node of n2 points to n3 and prev_node of n3 points to n4.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nOutput\\n\\n \\nIf you have any doubts regarding above doubly linked list in C and C++ tutorial then comment below.\\n</td>\n",

Unlike the linear linked list, the last node is pointed to the head using a rear pointer.\\nWe basically have 3 nodes head, rear and temp to implement a circular linked list. The rear points to the last node of the list, head points to first node. This helps to maintain a track on where is the front and rear nodes of the circle. Let us see the basic operations such as creation, deletion and displaying of the elements of the circular linked list.\\n \\nCreation of Node\\nThis is much similar to that of creating a node in singly linked list. It involves creating a new node and assigning data and pointing the current node to the head of the circular linked list. The code is as shown below.\\n \\n \\nDeletion of Node\\nWe conventionally delete the front node from the list in this program. To delete a node, we need to check if the list is empty. If it is not empty then point the rear node to the front-&gt;next and rear-&gt;next to front. This removes the first node.\\n \\n \\nTraversing Circular Linked List\\nTraversing the circular list starts from front node and iteratively continues until the rear node. The following function is used for this purpose.\\n \\n\\n \\nOutput\\nThe above program results in the following output. You can see that the last node points to the first node address that is the main theme of circular linked list in C.\\n \\n</td>\n",

And there is a Salesman living in village 1 and he has to sell his things in all villages by travelling and he has to come back to own village 1.\\nHe has to travel each village exactly once, because it is waste of time and energy that revisiting same village.

       "      <td>Here you will learn about Matrix Chain Multiplication with example and also get a program that implements matrix chain multiplication in C and C++.\\nBefore going to main problem first remember some basis.\\nWe know that, to multiply two matrices it is condition that, number of columns in first matrix should be equal to number of rows in second matrix. Let say there are two matrices A and B with dimensions A (2 x 3) and B (3 x 2).\\nLet’s see an example.\\n\\nAbove we can see resultant matrix is (2 x 2) matrix i.e. it contains total 4 elements. To calculate each element we did 3 multiplications (which is equal to number of columns in first matrix and number of rows in second matrix). So totally for 4 elements 4*3 = 12 multiplications are required.\\nIn generalized way matrices A (P x Q) and B(Q x R) will result matrix (P x R) which contains P * R elements. To calculate each element need “Q” number of multiplications. Total multiplications needed are P * Q * R \\nLet’s  try to multiply more than two matrices.\\nIf 3 matrices A, B ,C we can find the final result in two ways (AB)C or A(BC). We get same result in any way since matrix multiplication satisfies associativity property.\\nLet A (1 x 2 ), B (2 x 3 ), C ( 3 x 2 ). If we follow first way, i.e. (AB)C way.\\nTo calculate (AB) we need 1*2*3 = 6 multiplications. Now resultant AB get dimensions 1 x 3 this multiplied with C need 1*3*2 = 6 multiplications. Total 6+6 = 12 multiplications needed.\\nIf we follow second way, i.e. A(BC) way.\\nTo calculate (BC) we need 2*3*2 = 12 multiplications. Now resultant BC get dimensions 2 x 3. A multiplied with this result need 1*2*3 = 6. Total 12+6 = 18 multiplications needed.\\nHere we can observe that based on the way we parenthesize the matrices total number of multiplications are changing.\\nIf 4 matrices A, B, C, D we can find final result in 5 ways A(B(CD)) or A((BC)(D)) or (AB)(CD) 4. ((AB)C)D  or (A(BC))D. In this case also each way requires different number of multiplications.\\nGeneral formula to find number of ways we can find solution is  (2n)! / [ (n+1)! n! ]. After parenthesizing these many ways each way requires different number of multiplications for final result. When dimensions are large (200 x 250 like this) with more number of matrices, then finding the parenthesizing way which requires minimum number of multiplications need will gives less time complexity.\\nSo Matrix Chain Multiplication problem aim is not to find the final result of multiplication, it is finding how to parenthesize matrices so that, requires minimum number of multiplications.\\nEfficient way of solving this is using dynamic programming\\nLet we have “n” number of matrices A1, A2, A3 ……… An and dimensions are d0 x d1, d1 x d2, d2 x d3 …………. dn-1 x dn  (i.e Dimension of Matrix Ai is di-1 x di\\nSolving a chain of matrix that,  Ai  Ai+1  Ai+2  Ai+3 ……. Aj = (Ai  Ai+1  Ai+2  Ai+3 ……. Ak ) (Ak+1  Ak+2 ……. Aj ) + di-1 dk dj where i &lt;= k &lt; j.\\nFor more understanding check below example.\\nHere total i to j matrices, Matrix i to k and Matrix k+1 to j should be solved in recursive way and finally these two matrices multiplied and these dimensions di-1 dk dj (number of multiplications needed) added. The variable k is changed i to j.\\nRecursive Equation\\nNote: M[i, j] indicates that if we split from matrix i to matrix j then minimum number of scalar multiplications required.\\nM [ i , j ] = { 0 ; when i=j ; [means it is a single matrix . If there is only one matrix no need to multiply  with any other. So 0 (zero) multiplications required.]\\n= { min { M[ i, k ] + M[k+1, j  ] + di-1 dk dj } where i &lt;= k&lt; j\\nExample Problem\\nGiven problem: A1 (10 x 100), A2 (100 x 20), A3(20 x 5), A4 (5 x 80)\\nTo store results, in dynamic programming we create a table\\nThis table filled using below calculations.\\nHere cell 2,3 stores the minimum number of scalar multiplications required to.\\nUsing above recursive equation we can fill entire first row with all 0’s (zeros) because i=j (i.e. split happened at only one matrix which requires zero multiplications)\\nTable [1,2] = 10*100*20 = 20000\\nTable [2,3] = 100*20*5 = 10000\\nTable [3,4] = 20*5*80 = 8000\\nTable [1,3] = minimum of\\n= { (1,1) + (2,3) + 10* 100*5  = 0+10000+5000 = 15000\\n= { (1,2) + (3,3) + 10*20*5 = 20000+0+1000 = 21000\\nTherefore Table[1,3] is 15000 and split happened at 1\\nTable [2,4] = minimum of\\n= { (2,2) +(3,4) + 100*20*80 = 0 + 8000 + 160000 = 168000\\n= { (2,3) + (4,4) + 100*5*80 = 10000 + 0 + 40000 = 50000\\nTherefore Table of [2,4] is 50000 and split happened at 3\\nTable of [1,4] = minimum of\\n= { (1,1) +(2,4) + 10*100*80 = 0 + 50000 + 80000 = 130000\\n= { (1,2) +(3,4) + 10* 20* 80 = 20000 + 8000 + 16000 = 44000\\n= { (1,3) + (4,4) + 10*5*80 = 15000+0+4000 = 19000\\nTherefore table of [1,4] is 19000 which is final answer and split happened at 3.\\nSplitting way: (1234) is original in final outcome where 19000 answer we got split happened at 3 so ( 1 2 3 ) (4). Split for (123) means see at Table [1,3] that one minimum 15000 split at 1 . So ( ( 1 ) ( 2 3 ) ) ( 4). That means first do 2 x 3 and this 1 x first result and then this result x 4.\\nTime Complexity\\nIf there are n number of matrices we are creating a table contains [(n) (n+1) ] / 2 cells that is in worst case total number of cells n*n = n2 cells we need calculate = O (n2)\\nFor each one of entry we need find minimum number of multiplications taking worst (it happens at  last cell in table) that is Table [1,4] which equals to  O (n) time.\\nFinally O (n2) * O (n) = O (n3) is time complexity.\\nSpace Complexity\\nWe are creating a table of n x n so space complexity is O (n2).\\n\\nOutput\\nEnter number of matrices\\n4\\nEnter dimensions\\nEnter d0 :: 10\\nEnter d1 :: 100\\nEnter d2 :: 20\\nEnter d3 :: 5\\nEnter d4 :: 80\\nMinimum number of multiplications is 19000\\n\\nComment below if you have any queries related to above program for matrix chain multiplication in C and C++.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Here you will learn about Bellman-Ford Algorithm in C and C++.\\nDijkstra and Bellman-Ford Algorithms used to find out single source shortest paths. i.e. there is a source node, from that node we have to find shortest distance to every other node. Dijkstra algorithm fails when graph has negative weight cycle. But Bellman-Ford Algorithm won’t fail even, the graph has negative edge cycle. If there any negative edge cycle it will detect and say there is negative edge cycle. If not it will give answer to given problem.\\nBellman-Ford Algorithm will work on logic that, if graph has n nodes, then shortest path never contain more than n-1 edges. This is exactly what Bellman-Ford do. It is enough to relax each edge (v-1) times to find shortest path. But to find whether there is negative cycle or not we again do one more relaxation. If we get less distance in nth relaxation we can say that there is negative edge cycle. Reason for this is negative value added and distance get reduced.\\nRelaxing edge\\nIn algorithm and code below we use this term Relaxing edge.\\nRelaxing edge is an operation performed on an edge (u, v) . when,\\nd(u) &gt; d(v) + Cost(u,v)\\nHere d(u) means distance of u. If already known distance to “u” is greater than the path from “s” to “v” and “v” to “u” we update that d(u) value with d(v) + cost(u,v).\\n\\nFinally time complexity is (v-1) (E) O(1) = O(VE)\\n\\nThis is the given directed graph.\\n(s,t) = 6  (y,x) = -3\\n(s,y)= 7  (y,z) = 9\\n(t,y) = 8  (x,t) = -2\\n(t,z) = -4  (z,x) = 7\\n(t,x) = 5  (z,s) = 2\\nAbove we can see using vertex “S” as source (Setting distance as 0), we initialize all other distance as infinity.\\nTable and Image explanation: This table, 2nd row shows distance from source to that particular node ad 3rd row shows to reach that node what is the node we visited recently. This path we can see in the image also.\\n Note: In each iteration, iteration “n” means it contains the path at most “n” edges. And while we are doing iteration “n” we must follow the graph which we obtained in iteration “n-1”.\\nIteration 1: edge (s,t) and (z,y) relaxed and updating the distances to t and y.\\n\\nIteration 2 : edge (t,z) and (y,x) relaxed and x and z values are updated.\\n\\nIteration 3: Value of t updated by relaxing (x,t)\\n\\nIteration 4: Value of z updated by relaxing edge (t,z)\\n\\nUntil now 4 iterations completed and shortest path found to every node form source node. Now we have to do one more iteration to find whether there exists negative edge cycle or not. When we do this nth (5th here) relaxation if we found less distance to any vertex from any other path we can say that there is negative edge cycle. Here we can relax any edge to graph which obtained in iteration 4and we can observe that there is no chance to change those values. So we can confirm that there is no negative edge cycle in this graph.\\n\\nThis picture shows the Structure of our input graph.\\nWe create a structure called “Graph” which contains two integers int v (represent number of vertices) and int E (represents number of edges) and also another structure inside this structure which represents edge. That structure contains 3 integers source, destination, weight of that edge. So we create “E” number of structures inside the structure Graph.\\nAfter creating Graph, choose a source node and send to BellmanFord function. In this function we relax each edge “v-1” times. After this we can store the result of shortest paths in an array. And we do one more relaxation to find whether there exists negative edge cycle or not. If we got less distance at any node in Vth relaxation of edges, then we can say that the graph have negative edge cycle.\\nOutput\\nEnter number of vertices in graph\\n5\\nEnter number of edges in graph\\n10\\nEnter your source vertex number\\n0\\nEnter edge 1 properties Source, destination, weight respectively\\n0 1 6\\nEnter edge 2 properties Source, destination, weight respectively\\n0 2 7\\nEnter edge 3 properties Source, destination, weight respectively\\n1 2 8\\nEnter edge 4 properties Source, destination, weight respectively\\n1 4 -4\\nEnter edge 5 properties Source, destination, weight respectively\\n1 3 5\\nEnter edge 6 properties Source, destination, weight respectively\\n3 1 -2\\nEnter edge 7 properties Source, destination, weight respectively\\n2 3 -3\\nEnter edge 8 properties Source, destination, weight respectively\\n2 4 9\\nEnter edge 9 properties Source, destination, weight respectively\\n4 0 2\\nEnter edge 10 properties Source, destination, weight respectively\\n4 3 7\\nVertex  Distance from Source Vertex\\n0  0\\n1  2\\n2  7\\n3  4\\n4  -2\\n\\nReference: Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas H.

       "      <td>Data Encryption Standard is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encrypting the data. It comes under block cipher algorithm which follows Feistel structure. Here is the block diagram of Data Encryption Standard.\\n\\nFig1: DES Algorithm Block Diagram [Image Source: Cryptography and Network Security Principles and Practices 4th Ed by William Stallings]\\nExplanation for above diagram: Each character of plain text converted into binary format. Every time we take 64 bits from that and give as input to DES algorithm, then it processed through 16 rounds and then converted to cipher text.\\nInitial Permutation: 64 bit plain text goes under initial permutation and then given to round 1. Since initial permutation step receiving 64 bits, it contains an 1×64 matrix which contains numbers from 1 to 64 but in shuffled order. After that, we arrange our original 64 bit text in the order mentioned in that matrix. [You can see the matrix in below code]\\nAfter initial permutation, 64 bit text passed through 16 rounds. In each round it processed with 48 bit key. That means we need total 16 sub keys, one for each round. See below diagram, it will show what happening in each round of algorithm.\\n\\nFig2: Single Round of DES Algorithm. [Image Source: Cryptography and Network Security Principles and Practices 4th Ed by William Stallings]\\nRound i: In each round 64bit text divided into two 32bit parts. Left and Right. You can see in diagram Li-1 and Ri-1. As algorithm says, Right 32bits goes under Expansion Permutation.\\nExpansion Permutation: Right side 32bit part of text given to expansion permutation. It will produce a 48bit text as output. i.e. 16bits added in this step. Some bits below 32 are repeated and arranged in an 1×48 matrix form. We rearrange 32bit text by following the order of that matrix. [See the matrix in below code]\\nAfter expansion permutation we have to XOR the output 48bit with a 48bit sub key. Let see how that 48bit sub key generating from 64bit original key.\\nPermutated Choice 1: Initially we take a 64 bit key and then apply to permutated choice 1. It contains a 1×56 matrix but with shuffled 1 to 64 numbers except multiples of number 8. i.e. 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64 will be discarded. Remaining 64-8 = 56 number will be there in 1×56 matrix. We rearrange key in matrix specified order. [You can see the matrix in below code]\\nLeft Circular Shift: 56bit key from permutated choice 1 given to left circular shift operation. Here that 56bit key divided into two equal halves of each 28bit. These 28bits shifted depends upon the round number. We already have the data that in each round how many bits circularly we have to shift. You can see this data in shifts array in code.\\nPermutated Choice 2: Result of Left circular shift 56bit key given to permutated choice 2. This step will produce 48bit sub key. For this it has an 1×48 matrix, in which out of 56, some random 8 bits will be discarded. And remaining 48 will be there. According to this bit positions we have to rearrange the key. You can see this matrix in below code.\\nNow output of permutated choice 2 will be Xor with output of expansion permutation, which results a 48bit one. This 48bit again reduced to 32bit using Substitution boxes [called S box].\\nSubstitution boxes [S box]: In DES algorithm we have 8 S boxes. Input for S box is 48bit. And output from S box is 32 bit. The input 48 bit will be divided equally to 8 s boxes from s1, s2, … s8. So each s box will get 48/8= 6 bits as input. This Each S box reduce 6 bits to 4 bits. i.e input for each S box is 6 bits and output is 4 bits. Finally, 8*4 = 32 bit. Which is final output of S box operation.\\nLet see how 6bits converted to 4 bits from S box. S box is an 4×16 matrix containing numbers in range 0 to 15. Take example, assume input 6 bits for S box are 011011. In this first and last bit together represents row number. Since maximum number with two bits is 3, S box also contains 0 to 3 rows total of 4. And middle 4 numbers together represent column number. Since maximum number with 4 bits is 15, S box also contains columns 0 to 15 total of 16. So here first and last bit = 01 i.e. row number 1 and middle 4 bits 1101= 13 i.e. column number 13. So for this input the number positioned at row 1 and column 13 will be picked. As mentioned earlier S box only contains number in range 0 to 15. All can be represented in 4 bits. So picked number 4 bits are output for the S box. See the code for all S boxes.\\nPermutation: After getting output from all S boxes, we are applying again permutation. Here also a matrix with different arrangements will be there, we have to arrange according to that.\\nFinal XOR: After this permutation, take the left half which initially divided 64bit text to two halves. Do XOR with this permutation output to left 32bit part. This result is new Right part. And Right 32bit part which passed through all permutation will be come as new Left Part. These 2 parts will be the inputs for the second round. Same as keys also, the parts before left shift are next round input keys.\\nAll this explanation for a single round for a 62bit plain text. Like this, it passes through total 16 rounds.\\n32 bit swap: After completion of 16 rounds, final 64 bits divided into two 32 bit parts and they swap each other.\\nInverse Initial Permutation: Here also a matrix will be there, in which bits are just shuffled. No adding or subtracting bits. See the code for this matrix.\\n\\nOutput\\nDecrypted output is\\n0000111001101001001100011010111010010110111010111111111000010111001011111011111101010011011101011011000000111011100100000010110101000101011000011001000000101000001010011110101001011000111010011001110010110011011110110001101110000000001000001001000110111010\\n</td>\n",

This fixed time is known as time slice or time quantum.\\n3. The first process that arrives is selected and sent to the processor for execution. If it is not able to complete its execution within the time quantum provided, then an interrupt is generated using an automated timer.\\n4. The process is then stopped and is sent back at the end of the queue. However, the state is saved and context is thereby stored in memory. This helps the process to resume from the point where it was interrupted.\\n5. The scheduler selects another process from the ready queue and dispatches it to the processor for its execution. It is executed until the time Quantum does not exceed.\\n6. The same steps are repeated until all the process are finished.\\nThe round robin algorithm is simple and the overhead in decision making is very low. It is the best scheduling algorithm for achieving better and evenly distributed response time.\\nExample\\nLets take one example to understand it.\\nTime Quantum = 2\\n \\n Average Turnaround Time = 15.25\\n Average Normalized Turnaround Time = 3.10\\n Average Waiting Time = 10\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nIf you found anything incorrect or have any doubts regarding above round robin scheduling program in C then comment below.\\n</td>\n",

Based on some data the cash is lent to the customer. The banker can’t give more cash than what the customer has requested for, and the total available cash.  As this algorithm uses bank analogy so named as banker’s algorithm\\n\\nThe basic data structures used to implement this algorithm are given below.\\nLet n be the total number of processes and m be the total number of resource types in the system.\\nAvailable: A vector of length m. It shows number of available resources of each type. If Available[i] = k, then k instances of resource Ri are available.\\nMax: An n×m matrix that contain maximum demand of each process. If Max[i,j] = k, then process Pi can request maximum k instances of resource type Rj.\\nAllocation: An n×m matrix that contain number of resources of each type currently allocated to each process. If Allocation[i,j] = k, then Pi is currently allocated k instances of resource type Rj.\\nNeed: An n×m matrix that shows the remaining resource need of each process.

Let there are 5 (for example) philosophers. They sat at a round table for dinner. To complete dinner each must need two Forks (spoons). But there are only 5 Forks available (Forks always equal to no. of Philosophers) on table. They take in such a manner that, first take left Fork and next right Fork. But problem is they try to take at same time. Since they are trying at same time, Fork 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 taken by Philosopher 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively (since they are left side of each). And each one tries to ta ke right side Fork. But no one found available Fork. And also that each one thinks that someone will release the Fork and then I can eat. This continuous waiting leads to Dead Lock situation.\\n\\nAlso Read: Banker’s Algorithm in C\\nDining Arrangement\\nSolution: To solve this Dead Lock situation, Last philosopher (any one can do this) first try to take right side fork and then left side fork. i.e in our example 5th person tries to take 4th Fork instead of 5th one. Since 4th Fork already taken by 4th the person, he gets nothing. But he left 5th Fork. Now the first person will take this 5th Fork and complete dinner and make 1st and 5th available for remaining people. Next 2nd person takes 1st fork and completes and releases 1st and 2nd. This continuous until all finishes dinner.\\nOperating System\\nIn Operating System, this concept used in process synchronization. Same problem but instead of Philosophers processes are there and instead of Forks Resources are there. We follow above solution to avoid dead lock condition.\\n\\nOutput\\nFork 1 taken by Philosopher 1\\nFork 2 taken by Philosopher 2\\nFork 3 taken by Philosopher 3\\nPhilosopher 4 is waiting for fork 3\\nTill now num of philosophers completed dinner are 0\\nFork 4 taken by Philosopher 1\\nPhilosopher 2 is waiting for Fork 1\\nPhilosopher 3 is waiting for Fork 2\\nPhilosopher 4 is waiting for fork 3\\nTill now num of philosophers completed dinner are 0\\nPhilosopher 1 completed his dinner\\nPhilosopher 1 released fork 1 and fork 4\\nFork 1 taken by Philosopher 2\\nPhilosopher 3 is waiting for Fork 2\\nPhilosopher 4 is waiting for fork 3\\nTill now num of philosophers completed dinner are 1\\nPhilosopher 1 completed his dinner\\nPhilosopher 2 completed his dinner\\nPhilosopher 2 released fork 2 and fork 1\\nFork 2 taken by Philosopher 3\\nPhilosopher 4 is waiting for fork 3\\nTill now num of philosophers completed dinner are 2\\nPhilosopher 1 completed his dinner\\nPhilosopher 2 completed his dinner\\nPhilosopher 3 completed his dinner\\nPhilosopher 3 released fork 3 and fork 2\\nFork 3 taken by philosopher 4\\nTill now num of philosophers completed dinner are 3\\nPhilosopher 1 completed his dinner\\nPhilosopher 2 completed his dinner\\nPhilosopher 3 completed his dinner\\nFork 4 taken by philosopher 4\\nTill now num of philosophers completed dinner are 3\\nPhilosopher 1 completed his dinner\\nPhilosopher 2 completed his dinner\\nPhilosopher 3 completed his dinner\\nPhilosopher 4 completed his dinner\\nPhilosopher 4 released fork 4 and fork 3\\nTill now num of philosophers completed dinner are 4\\n\\nComment below if you have queries or found any information incorrect in above tutorial for dining philosophers problem in C and C++.\\n \\n</td>\n",

       "105  Here you will learn about prim’s algorithm in C with a program example.\\nPrim’s Algorithm is an approach to determine minimum cost spanning tree. In this case, we start with single edge of graph and we add edges to it and finally we get minimum cost tree. In this case, as well, we have n-1 edges when number of nodes in graph are n.We again and again add edges to tree and tree is extended to create spanning tree, while in case of Kruskal’s algorithm there may be more than one tree, which is finally connected through edge to create spanning tree.\\nAlso Read: Kruskal’s Algorithm for Finding Minimum Cost Spanning Tree\\nAlso Read: Dijkstra Algorithm for Finding Shortest Path of a Graph\\nThis algorithm creates spanning tree with minimum weight from a given weighted graph.\\nC program for constructing a minimum cost spanning tree of a graph using Prim’s algorithm is given below.\\n \\nEnter no. of vertices:6\\nEnter the adjacency matrix:\\n0 3 1 6 0 0\\n3 0 5 0 3 0\\n1 5 0 5 6 4\\n6 0 5 0 0 2\\n0 3 6 0 0 6\\n0 0 4 2 6 0\\nspanning tree matrix:\\n0 3 1 0 0 0\\n3 0 0 0 3 0\\n1 0 0 0 0 4\\n0 0 0 0 0 2\\n0 3 0 0 0 0\\n0 0 4 2 0 0\\nTotal cost of spanning tree=13\\nPrim’s algorithm contains two nested loops.

       "110  In this tutorial we will discuss about Breadth First Search or BFS program in C with algorithm and an example. Before jumping to actual coding lets discuss something about Graph and BFS.\\nAlso Read: Depth First Search (DFS) Traversal of a Graph [Algorithm and Program]\\nA Graph G = (V, E) is a collection of sets V and E where V is a collection of vertices and E is a collection of edges.\\nA Graph can be of two types:\\n1. Directed Graph\\n2. Undirected Graph\\nIn data structures, there is a popular term known as ‘Traversal’. It is the process of systematically visiting or examining (may be to update the Graph nodes) each node in a tree data structure, exactly once.\\nThere are two most common methods to traverse a Graph:\\n1. Breadth First Search\\n2. Depth First Search\\nIn this tutorial, we are going to focus on Breadth First Search technique.\\nIn this technique, we first visit the vertex and then visit all the vertices adjacent to the starting vertex i.e., 0. Next, we pick the adjacent vertices one after another and visit their adjacent vertices and this process goes on and on until we reach the last vertex.\\n \\nConsider below Graph as an example.\\n \\n\\n \\nThe vertex 0 is the starting vertex in our case. We start our traversal from the vertex 0. Then we will visit all vertices adjacent to vertex 0 i.e., 1, 4, 3. Here, we can visit these three vertices in any order. Suppose we visit the vertices in order 1,3,4.\\nThe traversal would be: 0 1 3 4\\nNow, we shall visit all the vertices adjacent to 1, then all the vertices adjacent to 3 and then all the vertices adjacent to 4. So first we shall visit 2 (since it is adjacent to 1), then 6 (since it is adjacent to 3) and 5, 7 (since these are adjacent to 4).\\nNote: Vertex 4 is adjacent to vertices 1 and 3, but it has already been visited so we’ve ignored it.\\nThe traversal would be: 0 1 3 4 2 6 5 7\\nNow, we shall visit all the vertices adjacent to 2, 6, 5, and 7 one by one. We can see that vertex 5 is adjacent to vertex 2. Since, it has already been traversed upon before, we have don’t need to traverse through it again and move on to the next vertex. Now, the vertices 4 and 7 are adjacent to the vertex 6. Since, they have been traversed upon before, we will not traverse on them again. Vertex 5 does not have any adjacent vertices. Vertices 5 and 8 are adjacent to vertex 7. Since, vertex 5 has been traversed upon before, we will not traverse it again. However, vertex 8 has not yet been visited. So we will traverse on vertex 8.\\nThe traversal would be: 0 1 3 4 2 6 5 7 8\\nNow, we need to visit vertices adjacent to vertex 8. However, there is no vertex adjacent to vertex 8 and hence we will have to stop the traversal here.\\nNote: There’s no unique traversal and it can be different based on the order of the successors.\\nWe shall look at a BFS program in C for directed Graph using a Queue. This program reaches only those vertices that are reachable from the start vertex.\\n \\n \\n \\nOutput\\n\\nIf you find anything incorrect or have any doubts regarding above Breadth First Search (BFS) program in C then comment below.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "111  In this tutorial you will learn about doubly linked list in C and C++.\\nIn singly linked list, we can move/traverse only in one single direction because each node has the address of the next node only. Suppose we are in the middle of the linked list and we want the address of previous node then we don’t have any option other than repeating the traversing from the beginning node.\\nTo overcome this drawback, a doubly linked list can be used. In this, there are two pointers. One of these pointers points to the next node and the other points to the previous node.\\n \\n\\nImage Source\\n \\nThe structure for a doubly linked list node can be declared as:\\n \\nprev_node would contain a pointer to the address of the previous node and next_node would point the next node in the list. Hence, we can move in both the directions.\\n \\nTraversal of a doubly linked list is similar to that of a singly linked list. We have to first check for a condition: whether the linked list is empty or not. This helps to set the start pointer at a proper location. After that we access each node till end.\\n \\nA new node can be inserted very easily in a doubly linked list. We just need to set the pointers prev_node and next_node carefully interlinking the prev_node and the next_node node with the appropriate pointers.\\nIf you’re inserting a Node n2 between Node n1 and n3, you should set the pointer prev_node of n2 to n1 and pointer next_node of n2 to n3.\\nInsertion in a doubly linked list can be done in multiple ways:\\n1. Insertion in between the nodes.\\n2. Insertion at the beginning.\\n3. Insertion in an empty list.\\n4. Insertion at the end of the list.\\n \\nA node can be deleted very easily in a doubly linked list. We just need to set the pointers prev_node and next_node logically to the nodes.\\nDeletion of the nodes can be done in the following ways:\\n1. Delete at the end.\\n2. Delete the first node.\\n3. Delete in between the nodes.\\n \\nAssume we have four nodes n1, n2, n3 and n4\\nSteps to reverse\\n1. Pointer begin points to the last node n4.\\n2. Since, the n4 is the first node now, its prev_node pointer must be NULL.\\n3. Node n1 is the last node, hence its next_node must be NULL.\\n4. Pointer next_node of n4 points to n3, next_node of n3 points to n2 and next_node of n2 points to n1.\\n5. Pointer prev_node of n1 points to n2, prev_node of n2 points to n3 and prev_node of n3 points to n4.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nOutput\\n\\n \\nIf you have any doubts regarding above doubly linked list in C and C++ tutorial then comment below.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "113  Here you will get program for circular linked list in C.\\nWhat is Circular Linked List?\\nA circular linked list is a linked list in which the last node points to the head or front node making the data structure to look like a circle.  A circularly linked list node can be implemented using singly linked or doubly linked list.\\nThe below representation shows how a circular linked list looks like. Unlike the linear linked list, the last node is pointed to the head using a rear pointer.\\nWe basically have 3 nodes head, rear and temp to implement a circular linked list. The rear points to the last node of the list, head points to first node. This helps to maintain a track on where is the front and rear nodes of the circle. Let us see the basic operations such as creation, deletion and displaying of the elements of the circular linked list.\\n \\nCreation of Node\\nThis is much similar to that of creating a node in singly linked list. It involves creating a new node and assigning data and pointing the current node to the head of the circular linked list. The code is as shown below.\\n \\n \\nDeletion of Node\\nWe conventionally delete the front node from the list in this program. To delete a node, we need to check if the list is empty. If it is not empty then point the rear node to the front->next and rear->next to front. This removes the first node.\\n \\n \\nTraversing Circular Linked List\\nTraversing the circular list starts from front node and iteratively continues until the rear node. The following function is used for this purpose.\\n \\n\\n \\nOutput\\nThe above program results in the following output. You can see that the last node points to the first node address that is the main theme of circular linked list in C.\\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "114  Here you will get checksum program in C and C++.\\nA checksum is a error detection method in Data Communication. It is used for errors which may have been introduced during transmission or storage. It is usually applied to an installation file after it is received from the download server.\\nThe actual procedure which yields the checksum, given a data input is called a checksum function or checksum algorithm.\\nAlso Read: Hamming Code in C and C++\\nChecksum method can only detect errors but is unable to correct the error.\\nIn this method a checksum is calculated based on the given binary strings which is sent with the data as redundant bits. This data + checksum is received at receiver end and checksum is calculated again, if checksum is 0 it means no error in data received, else there exists some error in the received data.\\nFor the purpose of this program we are finding checksum for 2 binary strings.\\n\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nThis article is submitted by Rahul Maheshwari.

       "115  Get program for caesar cipher in C and C++ for encryption and decryption.\\nWhat is Caesar Cipher?\\nIt is one of the simplest encryption technique in which each character in plain text is replaced by a character some fixed number of positions down to it.\\nFor example, if key is 3 then we have to replace character by another character that is 3 position down to it. Like A will be replaced by D, C will be replaced by F and so on.\\nFor decryption just follow the reverse of encryption process.\\n\\nBelow I have shared program to implement caesar cipher in C and

       "116  Here you get encryption and decryption program for hill cipher in C and C++.\\nWhat is Hill Cipher?\\nIn cryptography (field related to encryption-decryption) hill cipher is a polygraphic cipher based on linear algebra. Invented by Lester S. Hill in 1929 and thus got it’s name. It was the first cipher that was able to operate on 3 symbols at once.\\nAlso Read: Caesar Cipher in C and C++ [Encryption & Decryption]\\nEncryption: The given message string and key string is represented in the form of matrix. Then key and message matrix are multiplied. Finally modulo 26 is taken for each element of matrix obtained by multiplication. The key matrix that we take here should be invertible, otherwise decryption will not be possible.\\nDecryption: The encrypted message matrix is multiplied by the inverse of key matrix and finally its modulo 26 is taken to get the original message.\\nTo learn more about hill cipher you can visit following link.\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_cipher\\n\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nComment below if you

       "118  Here you will get program for hamming code in C and C++.\\nHamming code is a popular error detection and error correction method in data communication. Hamming code can only detect 2 bit error and correct a single bit error which means it is unable to correct burst errors if may occur while transmission of data.\\nAlso Read: Checksum Program in C and C++\\nHamming code uses redundant bits (extra bits) which are calculated according to the below formula:-\\n2r ≥ m+r+1\\nWhere r is the number of redundant bits required and m is the number of data bits.\\nR is calculated by putting r = 1, 2, 3 … until the above equation becomes true.\\nR1 bit is appended at position 20\\nR2 bit is appended at position 21\\nR3 bit is appended at position 22 and so on.\\nThese redundant bits are then added to the original data for the calculation of error at receiver’s end.\\nAt receiver’s end with the help of even parity (generally) the erroneous bit position is identified and since data is in binary we take complement of the erroneous bit position to correct received data.\\nRespective index parity is calculated for r1, r2, r3, r4 and so on.\\n\\nImage Source\\n\\n\\n\\nOutput\\nEnter 4 bits of data one by one\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\nEncoded data is\\n1010010\\nEnter received data bits one by one\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n0\\nNo error while transmission of data\\nCode Source: http://scanftree.com/programs/c/implementation-of-hamming-code/\\nThis article is submitted by Rahul Maheshwari.

       "119  Here you will learn about RSA algorithm in C and C++.\\nRSA Algorithm is used to encrypt and decrypt data in modern computer systems and other electronic devices. RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm as it creates 2 different keys for the purpose of encryption and decryption. It is public key cryptography as one of the keys involved is made public. RSA stands for Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman who first publicly described it in 1978.\\nRSA makes use of prime numbers (arbitrary large numbers) to function. The public key is made available publicly (means to everyone) and only the person having the private key with them can decrypt the original message.\\n\\nImage Source\\nRSA involves use of public and private key for its operation. The keys are generated using the following steps:-\\nNote: If we take the two prime numbers very large it enhances security but requires implementation of Exponentiation by squaring algorithm and square and multiply algorithm for effective encryption and decryption. For simplicity the program is designed with relatively small prime numbers.\\nBelow is the implementation of this algorithm in C and C++.\\n\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nThis article is submitted by Rahul Maheshwari.

       "120  In this tutorial you will get program for bisection method in C and C++.\\nTo find a root very accurately Bisection Method is used in Mathematics. Bisection method algorithm is very easy to program and it always converges which means it always finds root.\\nBisection Method repeatedly bisects an interval and then selects a subinterval in which root lies. It is a very simple and robust method but slower than other methods.\\nIt is also called Interval halving, binary search method and dichotomy method.\\nBisection Method calculates the root by first calculating the mid point of the given interval end points.\\n\\nImage Source\\nThe input for the method is a continuous function f, an interval [a, b], and the function values f(a) and f(b). The function values are of opposite sign (there is at least one zero crossing within the interval). Each iteration performs these steps:\\n1. Calculate the midpoint c = (a + b)/2\\n2. Calculate the function value at the midpoint, function(c).\\n3. If convergence is satisfactory (that is, a – c is sufficiently small, or f(c) is sufficiently small), return c and stop iterating.\\n4. Examine the sign of f(c) and replace either (a, f(a)) or (b, f(b)) with (c, f(c)) so that there is a zero crossing within the new interval.\\nAdvantage of the bisection method is that it is guaranteed to be converged and very easy to implement.\\nDisadvantage of bisection method is that it cannot detect multiple roots and is slower compared to other methods of calculating the roots.\\n\\nOutput\\na = -10.000000\\nb = 20.000000\\nRoot = 5.000000\\nRoot = -2.500000\\nRoot = 1.250000\\nRoot = -0.625000\\nRoot = -1.562500\\nRoot = -1.093750\\nRoot = -0.859375\\nRoot = -0.976563\\nRoot = -1.035156\\nRoot = -1.005859\\nRoot = -0.991211\\nRoot = -0.998535\\nAccurate Root calculated is = -0.998535\\n\\nThis article is submitted by Rahul Maheshwari.

       "121  Here you will get sliding window protocol program in C.\\nIn computer networks sliding window protocol is a method to transmit data on a network. Sliding window protocol is applied on the Data Link Layer of OSI model. At data link layer data is in the form of frames. In Networking, Window simply means a buffer which has data frames that needs to be transmitted.\\nBoth sender and receiver agrees on some window size. If window size=w then after sending w frames sender waits for the acknowledgement (ack) of the first frame.\\nAs soon as sender receives the acknowledgement of a frame it is replaced by the next frames to be transmitted by the sender.

       "122  Here you will learn about Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) with example and also get a program that implements Travelling Salesman Problem in C and C++.\\nLet say there are some villages (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). To work with worst case let assume each villages connected with every other villages. And there is a Salesman living in village 1 and he has to sell his things in all villages by travelling and he has to come back to own village 1.\\nHe has to travel each village exactly once, because it is waste of time and energy that revisiting same village. This is same as visiting each node exactly once, which is Hamiltonian Circuit. But our problem is bigger than Hamiltonian cycle because this is not only just finding Hamiltonian path, but also we have to find shortest path.\\nFinally the problem is we have to visit each vertex exactly once with minimum edge cost in a graph.\\nBrute Force Approach takes O (nn) time, because we have to check (n-1)! paths (i.e all permutations) and have to find minimum among them.\\nThe correct approach for this problem is solving using Dynamic Programming.\\nDynamic Programming can be applied only if main problem can be divided into sub-problems. Let’s check that.\\n\\nAbove we can see a complete directed graph and cost matrix which includes distance between each village. We can observe that cost matrix is symmetric that means distance between village 2 to 3 is same as distance between village 3 to 2.\\nHere problem is travelling salesman wants to find out his tour with minimum cost.\\nSay it is T (1,{2,3,4}), means, initially he is at village 1 and then he can go to any of {2,3,4}. From there to reach non-visited vertices (villages) becomes a new problem. Here we can observe that main problem spitted into sub-problem, this is property of dynamic programming.\\nNote: While calculating below right side values calculated in bottom-up manner. Red color values taken from below calculations.\\nT ( 1, {2,3,4} ) = minimum of\\n= { (1,2) + T (2,  {3,4} )     4+6=10\\n= { (1,3)  + T (3, {2,4} )     1+3=4\\n= { (1,4) + T (4, {2,3} )     3+3=6\\nHere minimum of above 3 paths is answer but we know only values of (1,2) , (1,3) , (1,4) remaining thing which is T ( 2, {3,4} ) …are new problems now. First we have to solve those and substitute here.\\nT (2, {3,4} )   = minimum of\\n=  { (2,3) + T (3, {4} )     2+5=7\\n= { (2,4) + T {4, {3} )     1+5=6\\nT (3, {2,4} )   = minimum of\\n=  { (3,2) + T (2, {4} )     2+1=3\\n= { (3,4) + T {4, {2} )     5+1=6\\nT (4, {2,3} )   = minimum of\\n=  { (4,2) + T (2, {3} )     1+2=3\\n= { (4,3) + T {3, {2} )     5+2=7\\nT ( 3, {4} ) =  (3,4) + T (4, {} )     5+0=5\\nT ( 4, {3} ) =  (4,3) + T (3, {} )     5+0=5\\nT ( 2, {4} ) =  (2,4) + T (4, {} )     1+0=1\\nT ( 4, {2} ) =  (4,2) + T (2, {} )     1+0 = 1\\nT ( 2, {3} ) =  (2,3) + T (3, {} )     2+0 = 2\\nT ( 3, {2} ) =  (3,2) + T (2, {} )     2+0=2\\nHere T ( 4, {} ) is reaching base condition in recursion, which returns 0 (zero ) distance.\\nThis is where we can find final answer,\\nT ( 1, {2,3,4} ) = minimum of\\n= { (1,2) + T (2,  {3,4} )     4+6=10 in this path we have to add +1 because this path ends with 3. From there we have to reach 1 so 3->1 distance 1 will be added total distance is 10+1=11\\n= { (1,3)  + T (3, {2,4} )     1+3=4 in this path we have to add +3 because this path ends with 3. From there we have to reach 1 so 4->1 distance 3 will be added total distance is 4+3=7\\n= { (1,4) + T (4, {2,3} )     3+3=6 in this path we have to add +1 because this path ends with 3. From there we have to reach 1 so 3->1 distance 1 will be added total distance is 6+1=7\\nMinimum distance is 7 which includes path 1->3->2->4->1.\\nAfter solving example problem we can easily write recursive equation.\\nT (i , s) = min ( ( i , j) + T ( j , S – { j }) ) ;  S!= Ø   ; j € S ;\\nS is set that contains non visited vertices\\n=  ( i, 1 ) ;  S=Ø, This is base condition for this recursive equation.\\nHere,\\nT (i, S) means We are travelling from a vertex “i” and have to visit set of non-visited vertices  “S” and have to go back to vertex 1 (let we started from vertex 1).\\n( i, j ) means cost of path from node i  to node j\\nIf we observe the first recursive equation from a node we are finding cost to all other nodes (i,j) and from that node to remaining using recursion ( T (j , {S-j}))\\nBut it is not guarantee that every vertex is connected to other vertex then we take that cost as infinity. After that we are taking minimum among all so the path which is not connected get infinity in calculation and won’t be consider.\\nIf S is empty that means we visited all nodes, we take distance from that last visited node to node 1 (first node). Because after visiting all he has to go back to initial node.\\nSince we are solving this using Dynamic Programming, we know that Dynamic Programming approach contains sub-problems.\\nHere after reaching ith node finding remaining minimum distance to that ith node is a sub-problem.\\nIf we solve recursive equation we will get total (n-1) 2(n-2)  sub-problems, which is O (n2n).\\nEach sub-problem will take  O (n) time (finding path to remaining (n-1) nodes).\\nTherefore total time complexity is O (n2n) * O (n) = O (n22n)\\nSpace complexity is also number of sub-problems which is O (n2n)\\n\\nOutput\\nEnter the number of villages: 4\\nEnter the Cost Matrix\\nEnter Elements of Row: 1\\n0 4 1 3\\nEnter Elements of Row: 2\\n4 0 2 1\\nEnter Elements of Row: 3\\n1 2 0 5\\nEnter Elements of Row: 4\\n3 1 5 0\\nThe cost list is:\\n 0 4 1 3\\n 4 0 2 1\\n 1 2 0 5\\n 3 1 5 0\\nThe Path is:\\n1—>3—>2—>4—>1\\nMinimum cost is 7\\n\\nComment below if you found any information incorrect or have doubts regarding Travelling Salesman Problem algorithm.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "123  Here you will learn about Matrix Chain Multiplication with example and also get a program that implements matrix chain multiplication in C and C++.\\nBefore going to main problem first remember some basis.\\nWe know that, to multiply two matrices it is condition that, number of columns in first matrix should be equal to number of rows in second matrix. Let say there are two matrices A and B with dimensions A (2 x 3) and B (3 x 2).\\nLet’s see an example.\\n\\nAbove we can see resultant matrix is (2 x 2) matrix i.e. it contains total 4 elements. To calculate each element we did 3 multiplications (which is equal to number of columns in first matrix and number of rows in second matrix). So totally for 4 elements 4*3 = 12 multiplications are required.\\nIn generalized way matrices A (P x Q) and B(Q x R) will result matrix (P x R) which contains P * R elements. To calculate each element need “Q” number of multiplications. Total multiplications needed are P * Q * R \\nLet’s  try to multiply more than two matrices.\\nIf 3 matrices A, B ,C we can find the final result in two ways (AB)C or A(BC). We get same result in any way since matrix multiplication satisfies associativity property.\\nLet A (1 x 2 ), B (2 x 3 ), C ( 3 x 2 ). If we follow first way, i.e. (AB)C way.\\nTo calculate (AB) we need 1*2*3 = 6 multiplications. Now resultant AB get dimensions 1 x 3 this multiplied with C need 1*3*2 = 6 multiplications. Total 6+6 = 12 multiplications needed.\\nIf we follow second way, i.e. A(BC) way.\\nTo calculate (BC) we need 2*3*2 = 12 multiplications. Now resultant BC get dimensions 2 x 3. A multiplied with this result need 1*2*3 = 6. Total 12+6 = 18 multiplications needed.\\nHere we can observe that based on the way we parenthesize the matrices total number of multiplications are changing.\\nIf 4 matrices A, B, C, D we can find final result in 5 ways A(B(CD)) or A((BC)(D)) or (AB)(CD) 4. ((AB)C)D  or (A(BC))D. In this case also each way requires different number of multiplications.\\nGeneral formula to find number of ways we can find solution is  (2n)! / [ (n+1)! n! ]. After parenthesizing these many ways each way requires different number of multiplications for final result. When dimensions are large (200 x 250 like this) with more number of matrices, then finding the parenthesizing way which requires minimum number of multiplications need will gives less time complexity.\\nSo Matrix Chain Multiplication problem aim is not to find the final result of multiplication, it is finding how to parenthesize matrices so that, requires minimum number of multiplications.\\nEfficient way of solving this is using dynamic programming\\nLet we have “n” number of matrices A1, A2, A3 ……… An and dimensions are d0 x d1, d1 x d2, d2 x d3 …………. dn-1 x dn  (i.e Dimension of Matrix Ai is di-1 x di\\nSolving a chain of matrix that,  Ai  Ai+1  Ai+2  Ai+3 ……. Aj = (Ai  Ai+1  Ai+2  Ai+3 ……. Ak ) (Ak+1  Ak+2 ……. Aj ) + di-1 dk dj where i <= k < j.\\nFor more understanding check below example.\\nHere total i to j matrices, Matrix i to k and Matrix k+1 to j should be solved in recursive way and finally these two matrices multiplied and these dimensions di-1 dk dj (number of multiplications needed) added. The variable k is changed i to j.\\nRecursive Equation\\nNote: M[i, j] indicates that if we split from matrix i to matrix j then minimum number of scalar multiplications required.\\nM [ i , j ] = { 0 ; when i=j ; [means it is a single matrix .

       "124  Here you will learn about Bellman-Ford Algorithm in C and C++.\\nDijkstra and Bellman-Ford Algorithms used to find out single source shortest paths. i.e. there is a source node, from that node we have to find shortest distance to every other node. Dijkstra algorithm fails when graph has negative weight cycle. But Bellman-Ford Algorithm won’t fail even, the graph has negative edge cycle. If there any negative edge cycle it will detect and say there is negative edge cycle. If not it will give answer to given problem.\\nBellman-Ford Algorithm will work on logic that, if graph has n nodes, then shortest path never contain more than n-1 edges. This is exactly what Bellman-Ford do. It is enough to relax each edge (v-1) times to find shortest path. But to find whether there is negative cycle or not we again do one more relaxation. If we get less distance in nth relaxation we can say that there is negative edge cycle. Reason for this is negative value added and distance get reduced.\\nRelaxing edge\\nIn algorithm and code below we use this term Relaxing edge.\\nRelaxing edge is an operation performed on an edge (u, v) . when,\\nd(u) > d(v) + Cost(u,v)\\nHere d(u) means distance of u. If already known distance to “u” is greater than the path from “s” to “v” and “v” to “u” we update that d(u) value with d(v) + cost(u,v).\\n\\nFinally time complexity is (v-1) (E) O(1) = O(VE)\\n\\nThis is the given directed graph.\\n(s,t) = 6  (y,x) = -3\\n(s,y)= 7  (y,z) = 9\\n(t,y) = 8  (x,t) = -2\\n(t,z) = -4  (z,x) = 7\\n(t,x) = 5  (z,s) = 2\\nAbove we can see using vertex “S” as source (Setting distance as 0), we initialize all other distance as infinity.\\nTable and Image explanation: This table, 2nd row shows distance from source to that particular node ad 3rd row shows to reach that node what is the node we visited recently. This path we can see in the image also.\\n Note: In each iteration, iteration “n” means it contains the path at most “n” edges. And while we are doing iteration “n” we must follow the graph which we obtained in iteration “n-1”.\\nIteration 1: edge (s,t) and (z,y) relaxed and updating the distances to t and y.\\n\\nIteration 2 : edge (t,z) and (y,x) relaxed and x and z values are updated.\\n\\nIteration 3: Value of t updated by relaxing (x,t)\\n\\nIteration 4: Value of z updated by relaxing edge (t,z)\\n\\nUntil now 4 iterations completed and shortest path found to every node form source node. Now we have to do one more iteration to find whether there exists negative edge cycle or not. When we do this nth (5th here) relaxation if we found less distance to any vertex from any other path we can say that there is negative edge cycle. Here we can relax any edge to graph which obtained in iteration 4and we can observe that there is no chance to change those values. So we can confirm that there is no negative edge cycle in this graph.\\n\\nThis picture shows the Structure of our input graph.\\nWe create a structure called “Graph” which contains two integers int v (represent number of vertices) and int E (represents number of edges) and also another structure inside this structure which represents edge. That structure contains 3 integers source, destination, weight of that edge. So we create “E” number of structures inside the structure Graph.\\nAfter creating Graph, choose a source node and send to BellmanFord function. In this function we relax each edge “v-1” times. After this we can store the result of shortest paths in an array. And we do one more relaxation to find whether there exists negative edge cycle or not. If we got less distance at any node in Vth relaxation of edges, then we can say that the graph have negative edge cycle.\\nOutput\\nEnter number of vertices in graph\\n5\\nEnter number of edges in graph\\n10\\nEnter your source vertex number\\n0\\nEnter edge 1 properties Source, destination, weight respectively\\n0 1 6\\nEnter edge 2 properties Source, destination, weight respectively\\n0 2 7\\nEnter edge 3 properties Source, destination, weight respectively\\n1 2 8\\nEnter edge 4 properties Source, destination, weight respectively\\n1 4 -4\\nEnter edge 5 properties Source, destination, weight respectively\\n1 3 5\\nEnter edge 6 properties Source, destination, weight respectively\\n3 1 -2\\nEnter edge 7 properties Source, destination, weight respectively\\n2 3 -3\\nEnter edge 8 properties Source, destination, weight respectively\\n2 4 9\\nEnter edge 9 properties Source, destination, weight respectively\\n4 0 2\\nEnter edge 10 properties Source, destination, weight respectively\\n4 3 7\\nVertex  Distance from Source Vertex\\n0  0\\n1  2\\n2  7\\n3  4\\n4  -2\\n\\nReference: Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas H.

       "125  Here you will get implementation of priority queue in C and C++ with program example.\\nPriority Queue is an ordered list of homogeneous elements. In normal queue, service is provided on the basis of First-In-First-Out. In a priority queue service isn’t provided on the basis of First-In-First-Out service, but rather then each element has a priority based on the urgency of the need.\\nAn example of priority queue is a hospital waiting room. A patient having a more fatal problem would be admitted before other patients.\\nOther applications of priority queues are found in long term scheduling of jobs processed in a computer. In practice, short processes are given a priority over long processes as it improves the average response of the system.\\nPriority Queue can be implemented using a circular array.\\nAs the service

       "127  Data Encryption Standard is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encrypting the data. It comes under block cipher algorithm which follows Feistel structure. Here is the block diagram of Data Encryption Standard.\\n\\nFig1: DES Algorithm Block Diagram [Image Source: Cryptography and Network Security Principles and Practices 4th Ed by William Stallings]\\nExplanation for above diagram: Each character of plain text converted into binary format. Every time we take 64 bits from that and give as input to DES algorithm, then it processed through 16 rounds and then converted to cipher text.\\nInitial Permutation: 64 bit plain text goes under initial permutation and then given to round 1. Since initial permutation step receiving 64 bits, it contains an 1×64 matrix which contains numbers from 1 to 64 but in shuffled order. After that, we arrange our original 64 bit text in the order mentioned in that matrix. [You can see the matrix in below code]\\nAfter initial permutation, 64 bit text passed through 16 rounds. In each round it processed with 48 bit key. That means we need total 16 sub keys, one for each round. See below diagram, it will show what happening in each round of algorithm.\\n\\nFig2: Single Round of DES Algorithm. [Image Source: Cryptography and Network Security Principles and Practices 4th Ed by William Stallings]\\nRound i: In each round 64bit text divided into two 32bit parts. Left and Right. You can see in diagram Li-1 and Ri-1. As algorithm says, Right 32bits goes under Expansion Permutation.\\nExpansion Permutation: Right side 32bit part of text given to expansion permutation. It will produce a 48bit text as output. i.e. 16bits added in this step. Some bits below 32 are repeated and arranged in an 1×48 matrix form. We rearrange 32bit text by following the order of that matrix. [See the matrix in below code]\\nAfter expansion permutation we have to XOR the output 48bit with a 48bit sub key. Let see how that 48bit sub key generating from 64bit original key.\\nPermutated Choice 1: Initially we take a 64 bit key and then apply to permutated choice 1. It contains a 1×56 matrix but with shuffled 1 to 64 numbers except multiples of number 8. i.e. 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64 will be discarded. Remaining 64-8 = 56 number will be there in 1×56 matrix. We rearrange key in matrix specified order. [You can see the matrix in below code]\\nLeft Circular Shift: 56bit key from permutated choice 1 given to left circular shift operation. Here that 56bit key divided into two equal halves of each 28bit. These 28bits shifted depends upon the round number. We already have the data that in each round how many bits circularly we have to shift. You can see this data in shifts array in code.\\nPermutated Choice 2: Result of Left circular shift 56bit key given to permutated choice 2. This step will produce 48bit sub key. For this it has an 1×48 matrix, in which out of 56, some random 8 bits will be discarded. And remaining 48 will be there. According to this bit positions we have to rearrange the key. You can see this matrix in below code.\\nNow output of permutated choice 2 will be Xor with output of expansion permutation, which results a 48bit one. This 48bit again reduced to 32bit using Substitution boxes [called S box].\\nSubstitution boxes [S box]: In DES algorithm we have 8 S boxes. Input for S box is 48bit. And output from S box is 32 bit. The input 48 bit will be divided equally to 8 s boxes from s1, s2, … s8. So each s box will get 48/8= 6 bits as input. This Each S box reduce 6 bits to 4 bits. i.e input for each S box is 6 bits and output is 4 bits. Finally, 8*4 = 32 bit. Which is final output of S box operation.\\nLet see how 6bits converted to 4 bits from S box. S box is an 4×16 matrix containing numbers in range 0 to 15. Take example, assume input 6 bits for S box are 011011. In this first and last bit together represents row number. Since maximum number with two bits is 3, S box also contains 0 to 3 rows total of 4. And middle 4 numbers together represent column number. Since maximum number with 4 bits is 15, S box also contains columns 0 to 15 total of 16. So here first and last bit = 01 i.e. row number 1 and middle 4 bits 1101= 13 i.e. column number 13. So for this input the number positioned at row 1 and column 13 will be picked. As mentioned earlier S box only contains number in range 0 to 15. All can be represented in 4 bits. So picked number 4 bits are output for the S box. See the code for all S boxes.\\nPermutation: After getting output from all S boxes, we are applying again permutation. Here also a matrix with different arrangements will be there, we have to arrange according to that.\\nFinal XOR: After this permutation, take the left half which initially divided 64bit text to two halves. Do XOR with this permutation output to left 32bit part. This result is new Right part. And Right 32bit part which passed through all permutation will be come as new Left Part. These 2 parts will be the inputs for the second round. Same as keys also, the parts before left shift are next round input keys.\\nAll this explanation for a single round for a 62bit plain text. Like this, it passes through total 16 rounds.\\n32 bit swap: After completion of 16 rounds, final 64 bits divided into two 32 bit parts and they swap each other.\\nInverse Initial Permutation: Here also a matrix will be there, in which bits are just shuffled. No adding or subtracting bits.

FIFO (First In First Out) strategy assigns priority to process in the order in which they request the processor. The process that requests the CPU first is allocated the CPU first. This is easily implemented with a FIFO queue for managing the tasks. As the process come in, they are put at the end of the queue. As the CPU finishes each task, it removes it from the start of the queue and heads on to the next task.\\nAlso Read: C Program for Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling Algorithm\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n

       "131  In this tutorial you will learn about round robin scheduling program in C.\\nProcess scheduling is an important component for process management. In a multi-user and a time-sharing system, response time is one of the most important objective to be accomplished.\\nThere are many scheduling algorithms in C for process management such as:\\n1. First Come First Serve\\n2. Shortest Job First\\n3. Priority Scheduling\\n4. Round Robin Scheduling\\nHowever, this tutorial will get you clear with understanding of Round Robin Scheduling program in C.\\n1. The queue structure in ready queue is of First In First Out (FIFO) type.\\n2. A fixed time is allotted to every process that arrives in the queue. This fixed time is known as time slice or time quantum.\\n3. The first process that arrives is selected and sent to the processor for execution. If it is not able to complete its execution within the time quantum provided, then an interrupt is generated using an automated timer.\\n4. The process is then stopped and is sent back at the end of the queue. However, the state is saved and context is thereby stored in memory. This helps the process to resume from the point where it was interrupted.\\n5. The scheduler selects another process from the ready queue and dispatches it to the processor for its execution. It is executed until the time Quantum does not exceed.\\n6. The same steps are repeated until all the process are finished.\\nThe round robin algorithm is simple and the overhead in decision making is very low. It is the best scheduling algorithm for achieving better and evenly distributed response time.\\nExample\\nLets take one example to understand it.\\nTime Quantum = 2\\n \\n Average Turnaround Time = 15.25\\n Average Normalized Turnaround Time = 3.10\\n Average Waiting Time = 10\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nIf you found anything incorrect or have any doubts regarding above round robin scheduling program in C then comment below.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

It was developed by Edsger Dijkstra. It is designed to check the safe state whenever a resource is requested. It takes analogy of bank, where customer request to withdraw cash. Based on some data the cash is lent to the customer. The banker can’t give more cash than what the customer has requested for, and the total available cash.  As this algorithm uses bank analogy so named as banker’s algorithm\\n\\nThe basic data structures used to implement this algorithm are given below.\\nLet n be the total number of processes and m be the total number of resource types in the system.\\nAvailable: A vector of length m. It shows number of available resources of each type. If Available[i] = k, then k instances of resource Ri are available.\\nMax: An n×m matrix that contain maximum demand of each process. If Max[i,j] = k, then process Pi can request maximum k instances of resource type Rj.\\nAllocation: An n×m matrix that contain number of resources of each type currently allocated to each process. If Allocation[i,j] = k, then Pi is currently allocated k instances of resource type Rj.\\nNeed: An n×m matrix that shows the remaining resource need of each process. If Need[i,j] = k, then process Pi may need k more instances of resource type Rj to complete the task.\\n\\nIf you found anything incorrect in above program for banker’s algorithm in C then comment below.\\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "133  Here you will learn about producer consumer problem in C.\\nProducer consumer problem is also known as bounded buffer problem. In this problem we have two processes, producer and consumer, who share a fixed size buffer. Producer work is to produce data or items and put in buffer. Consumer work is to remove data from buffer and consume it. We have to make sure that producer do not produce data when buffer is full and consumer do not remove data when buffer is empty.\\nAlso Read: Banker’s Algorithm in C\\nThe producer should go to sleep when buffer is full. Next time when consumer removes data it notifies the producer and producer starts producing data again. The consumer should go to sleep when buffer is empty. Next time when producer add data it notifies the consumer and consumer starts consuming data. This solution can be achieved using semaphores.\\n\\nImage Source\\n \\nBelow is the program to implement this problem.\\nOutput\\n1.Producer\\n2.Consumer\\n3.Exit\\nEnter your choice:1\\nProducer

       "134  Here you will get program for lru page replacement algorithm in C.\\nLeast Recently Used (LRU) page replacement algorithm works on the concept that the pages that are heavily used in previous instructions are likely to be used heavily in next instructions. And the page that are used very less are likely to be used less in future. Whenever a page fault occurs, the page that is least recently used is removed from the memory frames. Page fault occurs when a referenced page in not found in the memory frames.\\nAlso Read: LRU Page Replacement Algorithm in C\\nBelow program shows how to implement this algorithm in

       "136  Here you will learn about best fit algorithm in C and C++ with program example.\\nMemory Management is one of the services provided by OS which is needed for Optimized memory usage of the available memory in a Computer System.\\nFor this purpose OS uses 3 methods:-\\nIn this section we will talk about Best Fit Memory Management Scheme.\\nBest fit uses the best memory block based on the Process memory request. In best fit implementation the algorithm first selects the smallest block which can adequately fulfill the memory request by the respective process.\\nBecause of this memory is utilized optimally but as it compares the blocks with the requested memory size it increases the time requirement and hence slower than other methods. It suffers from Internal Fragmentation which simply means that the memory block size is greater than the memory requested by the process, then the free space gets wasted.\\nOnce we encounter a process that requests a memory which is higher than block size we stop the algorithm.\\n\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nComment below if you have any doubts related to above best fit algorithm in C and C++.\\n

In this section we will talk about first fit scheme.\\nIn this scheme we check the blocks in a sequential manner which means we pick the first process then compare it’s size with first block size if it is less than size of block it is allocated otherwise we move to second block and so on.\\nWhen first process is allocated we move on to the next process until all processes are allocated.\\nAlso

       "139  In this tutorial you will learn about Dining Philosophers Problem in C and C++ with program example.\\nWhat is Dining Philosophers Problem?\\nThere are some Philosophers whose work is just thinking and eating. Let there are 5 (for example) philosophers. They sat at a round table for dinner. To complete dinner each must need two Forks (spoons). But there are only 5 Forks available (Forks always equal to no. of Philosophers) on table. They take in such a manner that, first take left Fork and next right Fork. But problem is they try to take at same time. Since they are trying at same time, Fork 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 taken by Philosopher 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively (since they are left side of each). And each one tries to ta ke right side Fork. But no one found available Fork. And also that each one thinks that someone will release the Fork and then I can eat. This continuous waiting leads to Dead Lock situation.\\n\\nAlso Read: Banker’s Algorithm in C\\nDining Arrangement\\nSolution: To solve this Dead Lock situation, Last philosopher (any one can do this) first try to take right side fork and then left side fork. i.e in our example 5th person tries to take 4th Fork instead of 5th one. Since 4th Fork already taken by 4th the person, he gets nothing. But he left 5th Fork. Now the first person will take this 5th Fork and complete dinner and make 1st and 5th available for remaining people. Next 2nd person takes 1st fork and completes and releases 1st and 2nd.

       "143  Here you will learn about flood fill algorithm in C and C++.\\nFlood Fill is a seed fill algorithm similar to Boundary Fill algorithm but sometimes when it is required to fill in an area that is not defined within a single color boundary we use flood fill instead of boundary fill.\\nFor this purpose we can create a function or we can use a predefined function in the graphics.h header file which takes 3 arguments:-\\nfloodfill(x,y,color)\\n\\n4 Connected Region (Image Source)\\nIn Flood Fill algorithm we start with some seed and examine the neighboring pixels, however pixels are checked for a specified interior color instead of boundary color and is replaced by a new color. It can be done using 4 connected or 8 connected region method.\\nBelow we use 4 connected region recursive algorithm to implement this algorithm.\\n1.

       "144  Here you will learn about boundary fill algorithm in C and C++.\\nBoundary Fill is another seed fill algorithm in which edges of the polygon are drawn. Then starting with some seed any point inside the polygon we examine the neighboring pixels to check whether the boundary pixel is reached. If boundary pixels are not reached, pixels are highlighted and process is continued until boundary pixels are reached.\\nAlso Read: Flood Fill Algorithm in C and C++\\n\\n4 Connected Region (Image Source)\\nFollowing is the algorithm for filling a region in a recursive manner with color specified fill color (f_color) up to a boundary color specified boundary color (b_color)\\n1.

       "145  Here you will learn about liang barsky line clipping algorithm in C and C++.\\nThis Algorithm was developed by Liang and Barsky. It is used for line clipping as it is more efficient than Cyrus Beck algorithm and Cohen Sutherland algorithm because it uses more efficient parametric equations to clip the given line.\\nThese parametric equations are given as:\\nx = x1 + tdx\\ny = y1 + tdy, 0 <= t <= 1\\nWhere dx = x2 – x1 & dy = y2 – y1\\nLiang Barsky line clipping algorithm uses 4 inequalities with 2 parameters p & q which are defined in the algorithm below.\\n1. Read 2 endpoints of line as p1 (x1, y1) & p2 (x2, y2).\\n2. Read 2 corners (left-top & right-bottom) of the clipping window as (xwmin, ywmin, xwmax, ywmax).\\n3. Calculate values of parameters pi and qi for i = 1, 2, 3, 4 such that\\np1 = -dx, q1 = x1 – xwmin\\np2 = dx, q2 = xwmax – x1\\np3 = -dy, q3 = y1 – ywmin\\np4 = dy, q4 = ywmax – y1\\n4. if pi = 0 then line is parallel to ith boundary\\nif qi < 0 then line is completely outside boundary so discard line\\nelse, check whether line is horizontal or vertical and then check the line endpoints with the corresponding boundaries.\\n5. Initialize t1 & t2 as\\nt1 = 0 & t2 = 1\\n6. Calculate values for qi/pi for i = 1, 2, 3, 4.\\n7. Select values of qi/pi where pi < 0 and assign maximum out of them as t1.\\n8. Select values of qi/pi where pi > 0 and assign minimum out of them as t2.\\n9. if (t1 < t2)\\n{\\nxx1 = x1 + t1dx\\nxx2 = x1 + t2dx\\nyy1 = y1 + t1dy\\nyy2 = y1 + t2dy\\nline (xx1, yy1, xx2, yy2)\\n}\\n10.

       "146  Here you will learn about cohen sutherland line clipping algorithm in C and C++.\\nThis is one of the oldest and most popular line clipping algorithm. To speed up the process this algorithm performs initial tests that reduce number of intersections that must be calculated. It does so by using a 4 bit code called as region code or outcodes. These codes identify location of the end point of line.\\nEach bit position indicates a direction, starting from the rightmost position of each bit indicates left, right, bottom, top respectively.\\nOnce we establish region codes for both the endpoints of a line we determine whether the endpoint is visible, partially visible or invisible with the help of ANDing of the region codes.\\nThere arises 3 cases which are explained in the algorithm below in step 4.\\nAlso Read: Liang Barsky Line Clipping Algorithm in C and C++\\n1. Read 2 end points of line as p1(x1,y1) and p2(x2,y2)\\n2. Read 2 corner points of the clipping window (left-top and right-bottom) as (wx1,wy1) and (wx2,wy2)\\n3. Assign the region codes for 2 endpoints p1 and p2 using following steps:-\\ninitialize code with 0000\\nSet bit 1 if x<wx1\\nSet bit 2 if x>wx2\\nSet bit 3 if y<wy2\\nSet bit 4 if y>wy1\\n4. Check for visibility of line\\n5. Determine the intersecting edge of clipping window as follows:-\\n6. Divide the line segments considering intersection points.\\n7.

      "First Come First Served (FCFS) is a Non-Preemptive scheduling algorithm. FIFO (First In First Out) strategy assigns priority to process in the order in which they request the processor. The process that requests the CPU first is allocated the CPU first. This is easily implemented with a FIFO queue for managing the tasks. As the process come in, they are put at the end of the queue. As the CPU finishes each task, it removes it from the start of the queue and heads on to the next task.\n",

       "      <td>This tutorial is about radix sort java program and algorithm.\\nHere is a very basic and detailed description of algorithm that we follow to implement the radix sort in java. We mostly rely on the place value of digits to sort it out in the given list. So, our first basic task is to find out the number with maximum length and then iterate the whole loop over the length of the digit.\\nNext we arrange every number considering 1s place value, 10s place value, 100s place value and so on till the length of the maximum digit.\\n1. Find the length of the number that has maximum number of digits.\\n2. Initialize i=0, Repeat the below procedure till the length equals i.\\n3. Fill the bucket with all the digits in ith position.\\n4. Sort out the digits according to the order.\\n5. If length=i, i=i*10, goto to step 3. Else go to step 5\\n6. Print the sorted array.\\nThe complexity of Radix Sort is far better than that of bubble sort and some other sorting techniques. It is as shown below depends on d and b.\\nO (d*(n+b))\\nd is digits in input integers.\\nb is the base for representing numbers.\\nLet us start the implementation of the program. First we define a class named RadixSort and obviously it has only one method named sort to sort the numbers given. This function is the central part of discussion and as always, we take the inputs for the user using the main function and pass it on to the sorting function. The below code snippet shows it.\\nYou can observe that the function that we are going to implement doesn’t return anything as its return type is void. It takes in an unsorted array of numbers and sorts it. Now we will have a look at the algorithm to implement the sort function. The algorithm says we need to first find the number of digits in the longest number.\\nUsing the above for loop we can find the maximum of all the numbers. Instead of finding its length we will iterate a while loop until the maximum number falls below zero by dividing the number by 10 for every iteration. Then sort the array using a temporary bucket and array b[ ] and place back the final contents.\\n\\n\\nOutput\\nRadix Sort Test\\nEnter number of integer elements\\n6\\nEnter 6 integer elements\\n12 9 15 4 0 1\\nElements after sorting \\n0 1 4 9 12 15\\nCode Reference: https://www.sanfoundry.com/java-program-implement-radix-sort/\\nComment below if you have queries or found anything incorrect in above radix sort java program and algorithm.\\n</td>\n",

By using parseInt() method of Integer class.\\n2. By using user defined logic.\\nBy using Integer.parseInt()\\nInteger.parseInt() method takes two arguments. First argument is a string and second argument is the base or radix in which we have to convert the number. The output is the integer represented by the string argument in the specified radix.

       "106  This tutorial is about radix sort java program and algorithm.\\nHere is a very basic and detailed description of algorithm that we follow to implement the radix sort in java. We mostly rely on the place value of digits to sort it out in the given list. So, our first basic task is to find out the number with maximum length and then iterate the whole loop over the length of the digit.\\nNext we arrange every number considering 1s place value, 10s place value, 100s place value and so on till the length of the maximum digit.\\n1. Find the length of the number that has maximum number of digits.\\n2. Initialize i=0, Repeat the below procedure till the length equals i.\\n3. Fill the bucket with all the digits in ith position.\\n4. Sort out the digits according to the order.\\n5. If length=i, i=i*10, goto to step 3. Else go to step 5\\n6. Print the sorted array.\\nThe complexity of Radix Sort is far better than that of bubble sort and some other sorting techniques. It is as shown below depends on d and b.\\nO (d*(n+b))\\nd is digits in input integers.\\nb is the base for representing numbers.\\nLet us start the implementation of the program. First we define a class named RadixSort and obviously it has only one method named sort to sort the numbers given. This function is the central part of discussion and as always, we take the inputs for the user using the main function and pass it on to the sorting function. The below code snippet shows it.\\nYou can observe that the function that we are going to implement doesn’t return anything as its return type is void. It takes in an unsorted array of numbers and sorts it. Now we will have a look at the algorithm to implement the sort function. The algorithm says we need to first find the number of digits in the longest number.\\nUsing the above for loop we can find the maximum of all the numbers. Instead of finding its length we will iterate a while loop until the maximum number falls below zero by dividing the number by 10 for every iteration. Then sort the array using a temporary bucket and array b[ ] and place back the final contents.\\n\\n\\nOutput\\nRadix Sort Test\\nEnter number of integer elements\\n6\\nEnter 6 integer elements\\n12 9 15 4 0 1\\nElements after sorting \\n0 1 4 9 12 15\\nCode Reference: https://www.sanfoundry.com/java-program-implement-radix-sort/\\nComment below if you have queries or found anything incorrect in above radix sort java program and algorithm.\\n   \n",

       "108  Hello everyone, in this program I am going to share a code to make a simple calculator in java using awt. This calculator works on two integer numbers. As you enter two numbers and then click on desired button, the result is shown in Result text field. When you will click on Cancel button, the calculator will be closed. So just go through the code and try it.

       "111   \\nBelow I have shared a program that will check a string is palindrome in java or not. In this program I am reversing the string and then comparing the reversed string with original string. I have used Scanner class to read the string from keyboard. If you find any difficulty to understand the program then you can ask your queries in the comment section.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "115  You can check string is alphanumeric in Java using matches() method of Matcher class. The Matcher class is provided by java.util.regex package. Below I have shared a simple Java program in which I have taken a string and I am checking it using matches() method.\\n \\n\\n \\nOutput\\n\\nIn above example, I have used a pattern “[a-zA-Z0-9]+” inside matches() method. It means that the string can contains characters in between a to z, A to Z and 0 to 9. Here + means string can have one or more characters. matches() method returns true if the string is alphanumeric, otherwise it returns false.\\nComment below if you are getting difficulty to understand anything.\\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "116  Here is the Java program to sort list of strings. This program uses compareTo() method to compare the strings and finally uses bubble sort technique to sort them. compareTo() method compares two strings and return an integer value. The returned integer value is interpreted as show below.\\nLess than zero: first string is less than second\\nGreater than zero: first string is greater than second\\nZero: two strings are equal\\n \\n\\n \\nOutput\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

The program is self explainable but still if you are getting any difficulty then you ask in comment section.\\n\\n \\nOutput\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "120  In this tutorial I will teach you how to generate random number in Java in a range.\\nThere are two ways by which Java random number can be generated. The first way is to use nextInt() method of java.util.Random class and second way is to use random() method of java.lang.Math class.\\nBelow I have shared one example for each.\\n \\nThe nextInt() method generates random number in a range. Below example will generate random number in between 1 and 10. Here 1 is inclusive and 10 is exclusive.\\n \\nOutput\\n\\n \\nThe random() method generates a random number in between 0.0 and 1.0. Here 0.0 is inclusive and 1.0 is exclusive. In below example I have multiplied the result with 10 and type casting it into int to get random number in between 1 and 10.\\n \\nOutput\\n\\n \\nIf you found anything incorrect or have any doubts regarding above Java random number tutorial then comment below.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
