       "2   Any household that had like 8 - 10 kids back in the 1900 - 1950 era would absolutely have a stay at home mom whose sole job was to take care of the 8 - 10 kids.\\n\\nAfter the women's rights movement and after WW2 we saw women enter the workforce at close to equal amounts as men.\\n\\nAfter a few decades the economy has become such that only like the top 8 - 10% of wage earners can afford to have their spouses be home makers. Which means for all the rest of us, both parents have to work, which means day care.\\n\\nFor my two kids, daycare was $25/day, times two kids, times 20 days per month or $1000 per month. Somebody making minimum wage makes $7.25 x 40 x 4 or $1160 per month.\\n\\nIn short, children are viewed as a financial burden because they absolutely are. And I've only used daycare as an example... That doesn't feed or clothe or house them, and even then, that's just keeping them alive... wait until I tell you about the ballet lessons that cost $800 x 4 classes per year. Oh... and we'd like our kids to be able to snowboard with us... lets tack on another 4 - 6 grand. Piano lessons? Gymnastics? Any other activity? More money.\\n\\nWe estimate we spend about 14K per year per kid. With two kids we spend about as much as the poverty line just raising halfway decent kids.   \n",

       "8   It does answer it. When you are close to the source of the sound it sounds different that when you are far away from it.\\nIf you sat next to a fire truck with it's siren on, it would sound different than if it was down the street. This is due to the way sound waves travel.\\n\\nThe same applies on a firing range. You're standing there with your gun and to you it's making this deep manly bang sound, but on the other end of the range it just sounds like a firecracker.\\nIt's the sound of the muzzle not the bullet that you actually hear.\\n\\nYou can't really appreciate the difference in the sound because you are not in the two positions at the same time.\\n\\nEdit: [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvxTn8XO83k) an admittedly bad video that explains it a bit.  \n",
